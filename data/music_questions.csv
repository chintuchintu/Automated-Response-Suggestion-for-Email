0,how long is this cord? the pictures looks like its only a couple inches?,"I took a photo: <http://imgur.com/G48f1C4>I bought the 1' version. You can see that the entire thing is just over 12"" long. Around 8.5"" of that is cord."
1,Has anyone used this to split a stereo signal?  Want to use with the AT2022 mic--which uses a stereo 3-pin XLR output.  Appreciate any info!,I believe this adapter yields a mono split and not a stereo split.
2,"Is the mike proprietary or could I use a higher quality mike? If so, would there be a difference with a better mike? (recording classroom lectures)",I don't ever use the stock mic that came with it.  I prefer the Sony Lapel Mic.  I have a number of these and they work great.
3,How does this compare to the Yamaha CGS103 3/4 size?,"The CGS103 is a CLASSIC guitar. While the FG JR1 is an ACOUSTIC guitar.   Classic guitars have thicker necks and rely on nylon strings. The thicker necks are made for easier finger picking styles like Spanish guitar music (Flamenco). You will notice on Classic guitars there is not usually a pick guard as it is more geared to finger picking/playing.  The FG JR1 is more for typical acoustic strumming with a a pick and while can certainly still be played by finger picking, that is not its main intention. The FG JR1 has steel strings (versus the nylon on the CGS103) but you can always change the strings on the FG JR1 to softer ones if you want. NOTE: Do not put steel strings on a Classic guitar (like the CGS103) as they do not have reinforced necks and are not made for steel strings. Acoustic guitars can handle either. - Hope that helped a bit!

4,Will this stand fit the Yamaha YPG235?,"Yes. 4 screws secure it in place and it works perfectly with the YPG-235. I purchased December, 2012"
5,does this beta 58a microphone have a switch to turn it on and off?,"Like most professional microphones, it does not. Most audio engineers do not want a switch as it introduces another point of confusion during a production (why no sound? Did the talent flip the switch? etc). If you absolutely need a switch for a special application, there are microphone cables with build in switches."
6,Where is the guiltar made and what is the width of the neck at the nutt?,"Well yes Epiphone does make guitars at the Nashville facility but I am pretty sure most (if not all) LP-100's are made in their (Epiphone) China factory. Mine absolutely is Chinese made. I measured the nut width at the top of the neck and it showed to be 1-5/8"" but ""official"" stats state it's 1-11/16""  I bought my Ebony LP-100 5 months ago new ( 1st electric and am novice)  and it is a Fine guitar for the money.  I upgraded to a LP Standard in Red 2 months ago but can't find it in me to sell the LP100 ( actually I have lighter weight strings on 100 model and use it when practicing Bends lol) http://www.epiphone.com/Products/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-100.aspx

7,will these fit on a Epiphone Les Paul,"They'll fit any guitar as far as I can tell.  I have them on strats, teles and a les paul.  Please note that the screws for these are bigger than the ones that come with the guitar so if you ever remove them the old strap attachments will not stay on again.  But why would you ever take them off, right?"
8,will this fit the Epiphone DR-100?,"Hi, The DR-100 is a dreadnaught class guitar so this case should fit perfect. I would also like to add this case is one of the most well constructed guitar cases I've ever owned. I've bought 2 of them for my Epiphone guitars. I wish I could find this nice of a case for my Gibson guitars. The only other wood constructed hard shell case I've found as nice were Martin cases and they start out at about $500. Hope this helps.."
9,How does this compare to guitar honey for cleaning and maintaining the fretboard?,I've never actually used guitar honey but I will say this...I used fast fret on all my guitars after I play and it keeps the fret boards clean and makes my strings last way longer!!!
10,"Does it come with a rack mount, and how wide is it?","It did not come with a rack mount and the unit is about half the size of a regular rack component. I have since replaced the unit with the Presonus Single Channel unit that has a tube, EQ and compressor all in one."
11,is this recorder coming with any cases?,"Yes,  I believe it came with a clear plastic sleeve that snapped shut."
12,"and I have to use the two juices or I can use one and if so, what is the most recommended","From my experience with the machine you wanna use the any ""low lying"" fog"
13,I have a couple of guitars that are too bright sounding using phosphor bronze strings. Would this be a good set to mellow the tone out and warm it up?,Yes ! Very much the control and sound of tone I needed!
14,Does this come with an oboe fingering option?,"No, it has no oboe fingering option. It only has 3 sax style and 1 flute style."
15,"This oil ""SuperSlick KRO Key Rotor Oil"" is proper for Saxophones?",Rotor oil is for brass instruments that have rotary valves like French horns and some tubas. You can use it like regular valve oil on piston valve instruments like trumpets.
16,Does the seat swivel?,"Yes, full 360 degree swivel in place."
17,Can it be a carry on when taking airplan ?,Yes
18,What is the difference between 5A and 5B? Wider? Heavier? Thanks.,5Bs are wider and a little heavier than 5As. Oak is heavier and harder than maple.
19,I am wondering what the true interior dimentions of this case as I am not using this for a keyboad,"The measurments are 58""L x 20"" W x51/2 "" Deep. I has a substantial pocket also. I'm very happy with both the quality and the price.  I've had other bags that fall apart at the seams  (literally).  I recommend it for any keyboard no matter the weight.  Regards Spike"
20,How many drums come with this order? Three (3) or one? Thank you!,The order only comes with one of the size that you specify. Hope that helps you. Randy C.
21,can you connect this to 4 channel dj amp,This is only for two cannel stereo operation. (R-L) You would need two units to do 4 channel. (front R-L) (Rear R-L)
22,the description says it only has 4 mic pre amps. but the XLR inputs for Ch 5/6 and for 7/8 say 'MIC'. will dynamic mics work on these last 2 inputs?,"Best Answer: There are six XLR inputs, meaning that, yes, you can connect six mics. But only the first four mic inputs have ""pre amps,"" which I believe you've confused mic inputs with pre amps, as these are two different things. Some mic inputs have pre amps and some do not. Simply put, a ""pre amp"" amplifies an XLR mic input signal. The purpose is to help increase the level of a weak/quiet mic."
23,What is phantom power?,"Phantom power is a power supply used to power condenser mics. The standanrd voltage on phantom power is 48v, but some mics may vary."
24,Will this fit a Little Martin LX1 with sound hole size = 3 1/4''?,I cannot comment as it did not fit the guitar I had purchased it for. I have since given the device away
25,"Hi, will this fit the Boss PSM 5 power supply/master switch pedal? Thanks a lot.","This fits all Boss pedals, as well as 99.99% of other pedals."
26,Is this possible to just play and not connect it on the computer ?,"No, this is only a controller. You need to connect it to a computer with music/instrument software or a MIDI-compatible instrument (like a synthesizer)."
27,Why wouldn't you just buy a powerstrip and plug each of your pedals into it?  Or a Visual Sound one plug that connects all the chained effects?,"This is very similar to just plugging all your pedals into a power strip. That assumes you have AC adapters for each pedal. Most pedals don't come with one and some are $20 or so. I actually have a bunch of AC adapters, but this is much more convenient. It's even nicer if you use one of these with a pedal board such as the Pedaltrain which has brackets to mount this power supply. As far as a daisy chain kind of thing like the Boss or Visual Sound that lets you connect multiple pedals, those are fine up to a point. I have the Boss daisy chain and I noticed that if I connect it to my wah wah pedal, I get a loud hum when I use the pedal. It just doesn't get enough power to the pedal. So I would use the daisy chain but then plug the wah wah pedal in using an AC adapter. The voodoo is just neater and more convenient. Each output is isolated so it's not just a daisy chain. Each pedal gets its own power individually. It can still be used with a daisy chain like the Visual Sound or Boss if you have more than 8 pedals. But again, if you have AC adapters for all your pedals and a power strip, that works too.

28,"Are these truly passive pickups like in the description, or active pickups as the image appears to indicate?","passive, no batteries here"
29,Does it come with a manual on how to get to the effects I want? It seems that its very confusing.,"Yes it does come with a hefty manual in various languages (English in a pamphlet apart). At first it's a bit challenging to get the effects you'd like, but with enough practice you'll eventually get the hang of it. It's a nice pedal for the price and for just general fun, but if you're a more experienced guitarist you'll probably want to buy your pedals separately. Behringer has a nice selection of inexpensive pedals that compete well with the competition. By the way, the link Eamon Doyle provides is the exact manual that comes with the unit. Good luck!"
30,what is the difference between slinky and non slinky?,"Short answer: marketing. For the real story see the Ernie Ball website, but if you trust my memory... many, many moons ago there were few guitar string makers and they pretty much made the same thing- strings that helped a guitar be heard in a Big Band environment. The Ernie Ball company was one of the first to start marketing ""boutique strings"" that were easier for the player to fret and to bend. Compared to other strings at the time (anybody remember Black Diamonds?) the word ""slinky"" pretty much described how they felt."
31,Anyone knows the dimensions of the bench?,"13.5"" w X 22"" L X adjustable H b/t 18"" - 22"""

33,"Can this plug directly into my DSLR, specifically a Canon T3i, or do I need to purchase an adapter? If so, which one? Thanks.","You probably could with an adapter, but you would not be happy with the sound. I've tried direct audio into the canon cameras and it has been terrible. I run it into a zoom h4n with great results."
34,What's included when you buy this mic? Cable? Shock mount? Or do you need to buy that somewhere else?,"When you get the microphone, it comes in a nice brown, wooden box that is lined with snug black foam (it's great for transporting). They will also give you a shock mount with extra elastic bands (to be used when the bands on the shock mount stretch out). There is also a foam filter covering for your microphone (I don't recommend using that as the wind screen, though. It's extremely thick. It's more there to protect your microphone from dust) and instructions included within a soft plastic bag. You will need to buy your own XLR Female (Pin) to Male (cord) or any XLR converter that you wish (XLR to USB, etc).   I will let you know as well that the shock mount is a bit flimsy and it is a tight squeeze for the mic (you'd have to pry open the shock mount to get the microphone back out). Personally, I'm trying to find a better shock mount but it is absolutely not necessary to get a different mount.  Overall, this microphone is a quality microphone (for its price) and you truly cannot go wrong with buying it!Good luck! :)

35,"I am considering this for a bass rig, but my Ampeg SVT-CL doesn't have an effects loop. Does this unit need to be in an effects loop to function?","The maxcom is best for vocals an controlling a mix which I use it for. You can use it for bass. Connect bass to MaxCom channel side line in 1 or 2 then to amp, if your running effects already make sure the maxcom is the last unit before amp. As a long time bassist if you have a compressor stick with that and go with the BBE 482 Sonic Maximizer to shape your sound that would be a better choice for bassist and guitarists.. Good Luck"
36,will this damage nitrocellulose-finish guitars?,"I have found that as long as you keep your stand in a normal temperature range setting, the rubber material will be okay.  However, if you place a guitar aboard and leave it for months without touching it, you may find that the rubber material will transfer to the guitar. But I have also had that occur with very good quality wall mounts. An expensive guitar? I would definitely keep cased until play."
37,"The main question I have is where do you keep it during live performance that is easy access? Seems slower than a spring, what solutions do u have pls","Hi Bill,  You just clamp it to the headstock like you would a spring type capo."
38,Can anyone tell me the exact width betewen the vertical sides of this shelf?,17 1/2 between the brackets and 19 including them
39,What is the lowest height it? Could it go as high as a piano?,The lowest setting is 27 inches to top of keyboard and the tallest setting is 38 inches to top of keyboard (not recommended) with a total of five different settings.  Has a perfect setting for the height of a standard piano.
40,Is it compatible with a Canon XF100?,Yes has standard xlr. I use on an xf100  and xf305. great for the price
41,"I'm a singing, gigging drummer and tired of headset mics. Would this be a good choice to place behind me and add a gooseneck and SM58 mic?",NO - weighs a ton I wouldn't want to take to gigs plus it is bulky and takes up a lot of floor space.  But I'm over 40 :)
42,are they make in china?,"Yes shure it is , bought a brand new j6 system and opened it up "" MADE IN CHINA"""
43,Is this strong enough to hold a Blue Snowball along with a pop filter?,I am not familiar with Blue snowball but this thing is pretty strong. I would guess it is strong enough & the price is great.
44,it shows 2 mics do you get 2 for that price?,"No, you get only 1.  I bit on that very thing.  The picture shows 2.  Thought that was what I was getting.  Certainly is misleading."
45,How many strings come in this package?,"There are six strings, for exact replacement of your current strings on your guitar."
46,Does it have open or closed tuners,The grover tuners have closed backs.
47,is it powerful enough for busking? (playing in the street around loud noise...),"No, good only in small regular bedroom."
48,Can I buy a replacement slide portion of tubing for my Regemental Bugle?  I have dented mine.,"the metal is  different thickness than a trumpet, you would have to be able to weld it."
49,What are the dimensions of the bag? My guitar is 42 x 17 x 5. Would it fit?,Yes it should. I have a full sized Fender CD-60 in mine and there is plenty of room to spare.
50,does anyone know if these can carry the Yamaha HS80's?,Yes. They should fit perfect on top on the platform. They may hang over a little but the stands themselves are sturdy enough to hold them without a problem. I think they are rated to hold up to 75lbs.
51,"would it fit my Epiphone SG Special,and how durable is it?","Hi, I bought the case for an American-made  early 1990s Gibson SG Standard classic which is a typically-sized SG. This guitar fits the case very well & the case is sturdy & well constructed.As you have an Epiphone  made in Korea I assume the specs would be the same or very similar but suggest you email the seller telling them exactly what you have & whether your model is compatible. The best of luck to you.  Tim"
52,will this case fit a 17 inch Benedetto style archtop?,"It perfectly fits a 1950s Gibson ES 150 and a 1950s Gibson L7C, both of which are 17-inch lower bout archtops with a 25.5 inch scale."
53,Does this stand's back fold up? Like the legs fold up and then the desk will fold up like folding a piece of paper or something?,"Yes. The long pole telescopes so to take the stand down you make the whole things shorter, then the legs just fold in. The desk is in quarters that fold , to answer your question, sort of like a piece of paper. There is a plastic tray (it's a separate part) that forms the lip on the desk: when you set the stand up and open the desk you slide the tray on to stabilize the folding pieces. Setup and takedown take just a moment. When it's collapsed the whole thing fits into a small rectangular carrying bag. It's quite clever, really. I like mine a lot."
54,I am a female just shy of 5'5 with small hands and a small frame.  I am worried this guitar will be too big for me.  Anyone smaller with experience?,"I bought this for my 15 year old who is 5'1 and it was just the right size for her - she also has a small frame, etc."
55,"Has anyone used this to accent walls? If so, could someone submit a customer photo and how well does it work?","Iʻve tried it, unfortunately I donʻt have a photo sorry.  But I can say it ""sort of"" works.  Depending on how tall the walls are, it doesnʻt throw as far up the wall as I hoped.  It just doesnʻt have enough throw.  I used it as an uplight against a white wall that was about 20ʻ high, and it got ""lost"" after about 10-12ʻ.  It does however work fine as an uplight on my speaker scrims, so if youʻre a DJ, looking for an affordable solution to lighting your scrims...this is good.  Also good for a light wash on a small area...maybe 10ʻ to 15ʻ feet.  If youʻre looking to uplight high walls... youʻd be better of spending the extra $50 bucks and buy the American DJ Mega Par Profile RGB LED, or the Chauvet version. I believe theyʻre both $99 or less.

56,Where can i get the support bars?,Mine came with three of them. I think extra ones are available to order right off the manufacturer's website though if you need more.
57,Does this have a compressor,Dont know what u mean by compressor?
58,Will the yamaha motif es 6 fit in this bag?,"Tho Im not sure, your yamaha motif es6 will probably fit.  The inside dimensions in inches are:  42L x 18w x 9 deep."
59,How should I connect if I'm trying to sing karaoke with a computer and this device? my speakers are computer speakers..I have 2 mic with 1/4 jack,"Hello there, You can use this device as a mixer. You can take the two karaoke mics and connect to the front mic jacks. You can connect the sound (headphones) out put of the computer to the RCA IN jacks at the back. But now you also need an Amplifier to which you will connect the Mixer RCA OUT in the back. You can connect any pair of speakers to the Amp. I hope this answers your query."
60,Is this the exact sheet music as it is played on the CD? Some reviewers say it is NOT.,The music and melody lines are the same and in the same key.  It does not provide the harmony lines.
61,"I would like to listen to music on my phone and listen the sound of my game on pc, through same pair of headphones. Is this possible?","You can, however it will only play through one side of the headphone because the device only plays mono."
62,Can I use the Behringer MA400 to receive stereo sound from my ipod/smart phone then output via the XLR output and into our church audio system XLR in?,"No, I don't think that what this designed for. You need a line matching transformer, which sometimes look like a tube with an xlr on one end and a mini on the other - not to be confused with just an adapter"
63,Can i use it for karaoke? I already have a xenyx 802 mixer without the effects processor.,Yes you can.... Have fun....
64,What size are these picks? Medium or Large?,"Well, I have fairly large fingers and they fit fine. But there is no need to worry as they can (and should) be bent to fit. Also note that like a lot of picks they should be fitted ""slanted"" so that  they meet the string at right angles. I thought that buying these would be the answer as I expected to ""feel"" the string with my fingertip. That does not really happen in practice. I recommend the National picks over these because there is less ""scraping"" noise on the string."
65,Size?,"It came as 3/8"" diameter X 1/2"" long shaft.  Standard size, will fit pick guard or rear routed guitars.  Will need some extra washers for pick guard mount, because they're so thin.  If not, will stick out a bit."
66,"Hi, I really interest in this case, and my guitar's size is 42x15x5, do you know if it fit this case?",Is that 42  length15 body5 fretboard?I'm more than happy to measure for you.
67,"Would this be good for my granddaughter who likes to sing, I thought she could record herself and play back. Is this what I need?","For singing, I wouldn't recommend this for someone who would just be starting. If she knows her way around sound equipment and software then I'd definitely recommend this or something of equal quality for the price. The microphone itself can only interface the computer through the mixer and then the USB hookup. This provides better quality than some other microphones when configured properly, but it's also more sensitive and will require a stand, and pop filter, which are not included in the set. I spent no more than $150 on this and the other equipment I bought for the purpose of live-streaming on the internet. Overall I'm highly satisfied with the use and quality i've gotten out of behringer products, but for your purposes I'm unsure of wether this is the best option.

I spent no more than $150 on this and the other equipment I bought for the purpose of live-streaming on the internet. Overall I'm highly satisfied with the use and quality i've gotten out of behringer products, but for your purposes I'm unsure of wether this is the best option.

68,Does this come with a stand?,It does come with a small tripod stand but I would recommend a weighted stand as it's a but heavy and tips over easily
69,how many watts RMS ?,450 per channel (2 channels) or 900 as a mono amp.You will need Audio Cable XLR type connectors .
70,How long can I expect these to maintain quality of sound? I know I can get 5 years of solid use out of a Share SM58 (small concert venue).,"I.'ve given mine regular use on live gigs, even dropped it on the ground twice.  After 2.5 - 3 years of service, this microphone still sounds great.  These appear to be built very sturdy.  I give this mic a regular work out.  It's up to the task."
71,"What is the difference between these strings and the D'addario prelude strings which I currently have?? Please answer ASAP, thank you!!!","It depends on what works for your violin.  I had a new set of Dominant strings, but before I put them on my violin, I bought a Juan Qin violin that had D'addario strings on that work so well that I hesitate to use the Dominant strings on it.  If you are not getting the sound that you want, you might think about buying a different violin (I went through several violins before I found  in the Juan Qin violin the sound that I like). ."
72,Will this work with a Blue Yeti condenser microphone?,"Absolutely not. The Blue Yeti has a somewhat unique mounting system, which requires a specialized shock-mount 'ring'. This mount is designed to work with a large number of condenser style microphones with a screw-on back end. Blue makes the Radius shock-mount for this very purpose. I'm afraid that while the Yeti is a lovely microphone, you pay for the high-quality/low-cost in the form of incompatibility with most third party mounting options."
73,Do you think it will suit privia casio px 150? I really want to buy but i do not know if it will fit,I have a Casio px-310 which is similar in size to the px-150. The Case was large enough for me to store my keyboard and also had room on the sides to store my peddles and such. The case had a little more room around the sides than I expected but the straps keep my keyboard from shifting too much.
74,So how do i connect this to my computer??,"Depends what connection cable you have. XLR Female to USB male Lsgoodcare 3M USB Male to XLR Female Microphone Cable for Windows 98SE 2000 XP VISTA Win7 Mac OS X or 3.3mm mini GLS Audio 6ft Cable 1/8"" TRS Stereo to XLR Female - 6' Cables 3.5mm (Mini) to XLR-F Cord for iPhone, iPod, Computer, Video Camera and more - Single"
75,Does the stand come with a mic clip?,A mic clip is included with the Shure mic in it's box along with a carrying pouch. I actually ordered a clip separate because I didn't know this and it wasn't listed. Hope this helps.
76,Does anyone have any experience with this system and outdoor wedding/reception? If so how did it work?,"Mine worked only for a couple of hours.  I was so discouraged, I haven't tried it again, but will. The company didn't respond to my complaint. DON'T BUY THIS."
77,Does this come with the threaded part that screws into the mic?,"Dear Blake, no it does not. If the threaded part that holds your mic to your mount is gone, this mount will not help you."
78,Is this huge for all in one pc?,"In terms of the overall desktop footprint of the monitors? They're only maybe 5x7 dimensions and about 7"" deep or so, not that big, a bit of weight to them, few pounds, but I would say they're ideal for an all in one,laptop, etc., as long as you have some kind of small desk to put them on.I have a basic PC desk, not gigantic, but it has an upper shelf above themain desk, so I put them right up there at ear level or so, and that seemsto be ideal for me.  But I would say these monitors are ideal for any basic PCor small computer setup.  Plus they're USB so I would imagine you could evenplug 'em into an Ipad or whatever and they should be fine, as well.

79,how are they for hifi sound,"Actually it is more practical than using as portible sound because they are not the most well made product, however if you hook up a nice amp to them you can actually get a good clean sound out of them. I'd recommend them for the price."
80,how tall are they?,Hi James they are around 5 ft they have wheels I opted not to install them
81,Are these ball or tie ends?,"Very few classical guitar strings come with ball ends, and they say so when they do.  EJ-45 are the main string I use - tried and true, not expensive, highly recommended."
82,would this fit a 1959 Gibson archtop L-48?,I don't think so. It is tight for my Les Paul.
83,Will this tuner handle a 5-string bass? E.g.- B/E/A/D/G,It should not give you any trouble tuning a bass. I don't personally play bass but as long as it is first in your chain it should handle a bass just fine as Korg advertises it as a guitar/bass tuner. I hope that helps.
84,How do these compare to Bose noise cancelling headphones in terms of noise cancellation capability?,"They don't. These are not noise-cancelling headphones, they're just closed. Sound wise they're way better though."
85,"Does the DIGITECH RP500 include a ""Drum Machine"", i.e., several drum patterns that can be played anytime?",No it doesn't have a drum machine.
86,"Hello, I would like to buy this guitar for my boyfriend but he is an experienced guitarist. Can this guitar suit him anyway?",I bought this for my husband who had never played guitar before.  I was really impressed with the quality for the price if this guitar!  It is also a beautiful color.  I think it would work for beginner and experienced both!
87,would this hold 3 heavy basses? I dont want to spend 100 dollars but I need to hold all of my basses in a small room. Also how long is the shipping box? I cant receive any packages over 36 inches.,"I wouldn't think there would be a problem, especially since each instrument sits over a leg. And I have no idea how big the shipping box was, but folded up, it is 34"" long."
88,"Does this guitar come with the power cable, or do I need to get one before it arrives?",By power cable do you mean a cord to plug the guitar into an amp? If yes then it does but it is only 2 to 3 ft
89,Would you please measure the bag?  The Yamaha 235 is 43+ inches long.,"About 50"" - My YPG-235 fits it in just fine"
90,What kind of Microphone work  with this Product? I have the  Behringer C-1 Microphone which is not working. I just got it two days ago. Please help.,The Behringer C-1 is a condensor microphone. It requires what is called phantom power. This is where the device it is plugged into provides 48 volts DC to power the microphone. The mixer does not provide phantom power. You can use an external power supply for the mic which would plug inline between the mic and the mixer.
91,"Is this keyboard weighted, or is it just touch sensitive ?","The keys are light feeling and probably not weighted, but you can open the ""FUNCTION"" menu and there is a ""TOUCH"" option:  ""OFF"", ""1"" and ""2"".  ""2"" is the highest/most sensitive setting and makes it feel more like a real piano.  I turn the touch response to ""OFF"" when I am using the keyboard for midi or recording.  The touch response is quite nice.  The velocity/volume of the note depends on how FAST you hit the key, not how HARD you hit the key.  The keys do feel pretty light to be honest though.  But this alone should not deter you from buying the keyboard.

92,"If the device isn't recognized as a midi device, how do you fix it?","Shortly after asking the question I found the answer.  It wasn't the drivers, nor the operating system.  The problem was that while the computer may have a whole lot of midi drivers on it if we use a lot of different midi devices, let's say we have 20; well the Korg nanoKontrol will only be recognized if it's one of the first 9 to be installed.  Kind of like Justin Beeber at Disneyland....if he can't be at the front of the line, he won't go.  BUT the fix for it is in this YouTube video.  The guy shows all the steps to take:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9OfwDr8oYQ"

95,are these with stainless steel posts?,"They are not posts, but French hooks and I think they are stainless steel, but I'm not sure."
96,Does it record and playback.,"It does not record and playback, but we easily hooked ours up to an old VCR and do our recording/playback from that."
97,Does this product come with a warning that it contains cancer causing chemicals?,Do not eat this bench
98,Is this worth the extra $100 dollars over the PreSonus 24/96 or should I stick to my budget and use the extra money elsewhere?,It is very much wroth the extra $100. The Pro 40 has some great preamps and you'll get two headphone out's. One for you and another for your vocalist.
99,What speaker cable is needed for this?,"You need to use speaker cables....NOT guitar or instrument cables. Use speaker cables only, you'll have a better sound."
100,"Aside form tuning, is this banjo set up and ready to play?","Yes, with very little tuning required"
101,"I just purchased a Canon Vixia G20.  Would this work without having to buy any adapters?  I'm not a tech geek, so looking for the most straightforward",My cd player/radio/tape player has a 'mic' adapter plug and I plug it into that.  It works fine.
102,How Many computer authorize does this crossgrade has?,"Mine came with 2, YMMV"
103,How do I tighten the strings?,You can use pegs on the neck and also fine tuners on the tailpiece.
104,Can the stand portion that holds the laptop lie flat? Or does it always need to be at an angle like in the images?,You can turn it to any angle and fix in any position.
105,Does this have a battery outlet where you can change the battery,"It has a small compartment in the back and it comes with a 9v battery but you can change the battery, it also has a plug to plug into a wall outlet, but it doesn't come with the cord"
106,Does this mandolin sound loud and good without being plugged in or does it have to be plugged in to sound good?,"You can play this mandolin with or without being plugged. When unplugged you have  a loud and good sound depending on the picks and strings you use. When plugged to a 10 watt amp you  fill ,let's say, a pub or a small hall with its sound, when you want to play in a concert hall you need more, of course. I use different picks for different songs and kinds of music, but you have to try out what suits you best. All in all it's a very nice instrument."
107,"hello, is the rechargebale case include in the offer? what is the addistional cost?","Hello, Unfortunately this unit does not have rechargeable capabilities. You can use standard AA rechargeable batteries, available at most electronics stores, but you cannot recharge the batteries inside the unit. Thanks for choosing Discount Audio!"
108,Does this come with the microphone or do I have to buy that separately?,That has to be purchased separately. This is the one I use. DBX Driverack RTA Condenser Microphone
109,"What is the difference between all the frequencies? N1 to N4? I just need to use as a fitness instructor. Also, Does this system hook up to speakers?","There are actually five frequencies, a seperate one for each microphone in the same venue.  If you are only using one microphone, it doesn't matter which one you use.  This will hook up to a powered speaker, but will need an amplifier for an unpowered speaker."
110,"I have a Snarling Dogs wah wah pedal, it's 10 ½ "", is there enough length to fit that on this board?",Depends on what other effects you plan on using
111,does this foot controller work fine with the line 6 spider iii amp?,"Oh gosh, I'm not familiar with the Spider III. On the Spider IV, it hooks up with an ethernet cable to a port labeled ""FBV Pedal"". If the Spider III has the same kind of port, then I guess it should work. Wait! I just checked the Line 6 website, and YES it is compatible with the Spider III. Here's the link:  http://line6.com/support/docs/DOC-2413"
112,"If I order this to ship to Portugal / Azores, does it come with a 220v power supply?","The transformer handles 110-240V, so all you need is a fitting Portuguese adapter for american plugs"
113,Will this stand work with the Privia PX320?,"I read in the reviews above that this model stand (cs-67) does not work for the px-320 or the px-120, which  is the one I have. I think only the cs-65 stand works with those older models of digital pianos, and the cs-65 stand is discontinued/out of stock everywhere. I just bought a wall table that has very similar measurements/look instead here: Convenience Concepts 111091 Northfield Wall Console, Espresso and hope to use that instead."
114,Would I be able to just use a XLR to USB adapter to connect this mic to my laptop?,"I'm not 100% certain but it would probably work, presuming you mean an XLR to USB interface such as ART XConnect, Shure X2u, Blue Icicle, MXL Mic Mate, etc. But if you mean a straight wired adapter with no circuitry I feel that would not work. Be aware that the MXL R144 Ribbon mic has low output (like all/most ribbon mics) relative to other types of mics, meaning a pre-amp is typically required. Perhaps the interfaces I mentioned that have integral pre-amp would provide sufficient ""oomph"" but I don't know."
115,What case works well with the tele head?,"Mine came with a zipper case, so that's what I use. It plays well too!"
116,"I'm using the supplied 1/8"" Male to XLR Male Cable but only getting audio on one channel. Do I need another type for dual?",Microphones are mono and usually only work on one channel.  What amplifier are you connecting it to?
117,"Hello, What kind of batteries does it use? Thanks a lot.",As
118,Will i be able to unscrew to holder on the top? To attach the shockmount for my condenser mic?,"Yes, but don't expect quality at all. It's problaby the worst stand I've ever had."
119,Does it get hot? If used in an attic or crawl space of a home (for critter control) will it get hot enough to create fire hazard?,No. Both of mine have ran cool for long periods of time
120,"Does this work with wind instruments? I know it has ""for strings"" in the title, but I'm just wondering if it will tune a trumpet or trombone or any other wind instrument.  If anyone knows then please respond.  Thanks!

121,"how do these work electrically, do they come with an adapter or a plug to plug into a receptacle???","Your house runs on alternating current, AC.   The LED lights run on direct current, DC.    Thus , there has to be a gizmo to convert AC from your house outlet to DC for the lights.    Sometimes they're called power supplies and sometimes they're called transformers.   In any event, you need the gizmo that goes between the LEDs and the AC outlet in your house.    The DC end of the gizmo is a cylindrical fitting that receives the lead wire from the LEDs.   The other end of the gizmo has a normal two-prong plug that plugs into the wall.   So that the lights don't glow all the time, there has to be a switch in the circuit somewhere and that depends on your particular situation.   You may be plugging into a wall outlet that already has a switch in the circuit.   If that's the case, you don't have to do anything more.

123,Is it better than a Kun shoulder rest???,"I like it better because it stays on the violin better than my old Kun. The feet are made so that the toes can move a little which enables the grip. There are holes in the rest so you can position the legs two ways on each side. The curve of the rest stays on my shoulder better than the Kun. I have used my Everest for a few years now. The foam is still soft, and the rubber on the feet still grips well. I used the height adjustment on the Everest legs to increase the height because I have a long neck and it is a perfect fit. I used to be embarrassed when the Kun fell off while I was playing. The Everest has never fallen off, even when I'm playing hard. At this point I don't think I'd go back to a Kun.

127,Does it come with cable? If not what kind of cable do i need for this,The only cable you'll need is an instrument cable to connect your guitar (bass) to the amplifier.
128,"Can I buy belt for my Thorens TD190 in Amazon?, Thanks",This belt is not the proper size for any Thorens Belt-Drive turntable. I purchased mine for Technics turntables.
129,How loud can it get while staying clean?,"Not very, but it's by design.  Since there's only a single knob to control both gain and volume, it breaks up pretty early, at least in my experience with a 1x12 and 2x12.  The gain stepping is also pretty aggressive as you turn the knob.  Others below seem to disagree but what constitutes ""clean"" and ""loud"" is highly subjective.  There are however well published mods that you can do (or have done) to add tone, volume, etc. controls to the head.  While it does sound great for a $100 tube amp, if you're going to consider investing in the mods it's probably more sensible to just buy a small head with more controls for the same additive price.

144,"This is clearly a knockoff of the Behringer model sold for $39.99 on Amazon.  Is it a piece of crap, or is it comparable to the name brand one?",Not sure what the Behringer model is like but I had latency problems with my Imac. I would get a better Interface
145,Is there an aux input on this thing if I want to plug in an iPod or external music source to play along with?,Nope. But if you got clever with mixing in a 2 to 1 splitter on the input side you should  be able to accomplish the same thing. I say clever because the input is 1/4 and obviously what you plug in will be 1/8. You will also lose the stereo since the output is only mono. Still may be worth it since this sucker is pretty good at amping up and is affordable and durable.
146,Can the pitch be adjusted if necessary to match A=440? I have an older keyboard that's slightly out-of-tune and it can't be changed.,"YES IT CAN!!!!!  If you look at the section where your ""tone/pattern/song bank"" buttons are you will see the word TUNE colored in white with a line to both the tone button and a line to the pattern button.  You have to push both the tone and pattern buttons simultaneously and your keyboard will show the function on it's display.  Using the ""minus and plus"" buttons located on the numeric keypad, you can adjust it up or down.  The instruction booklet even explains this folks."
147,Need to know the kind of strap to buy for this guitar.  Left Handed Black Acoustic Electric Guitar Full Size Thinline Cutaway Body,Any strap you like. Always get strap locks to go along with your strap. :)
148,It says don't use 2 strips with power adapter. Can I cut one strip in two lengths and use it with included Y connector?,"Yes you can.... I cut mine in 5 or 6 strips and connected them to fit my setting. Works just fine. The overall power consumption of all the strips is still the same even if you cut it in 10 pieces....just don't go and buy any additional strips that increases the overall lights on the power adapters, then you might have problems. These lights are great."
149,I got this today but it is easily out of tuned (every hour). Is this normal for a new instrument?,"Yes, this is normal. It takes time for new strings to stretch out. This happens any time you change strings and it's true for guitars, ukes, basses etc... If you are careful and don't just yank or rip at them, you can lightly pull each individual string up to help break it in quicker by laying the uke on your lap or on a table with the strings up and put your finder under he drying about half way between the top of the neck and the bottom and just pull up on the string and hold it for about 10-30 seconds. Don't pull pull until it feels like it will snap just tug a little depending on the which string. The thick strings you might be able to pull a half inch and the thinner strings maybe a quarter inch do this for each string a couple times. Re-tune all the strings and do this 3 or four times and you should notice it going out of fine less and less each time. After a few times just start playing it and you will notice that it stays in tune much better. After a few days if playing, the neck and strings should be fully broken in and you should be able to go anyway where between a few days and weeks without really needing to tune it again (more or less time depending on how often you play it and how hard you strum)

150,Would this work with a banjo dulcimer?,Kathleen I don't know about dulcimers. The bridge would have to be the same thickness as a banjo and at least 3 8th inch clearance between the strings and the instrument. I love mine. No hassle just slides under the strings.
151,"Can an 8 ohm  1 x 12 or 4x12 cabinet be added, is there a jack in the back of the amp to accomplish adding a cabinet, and  if a cabinet is added, does","I don't see and easy way to connect an auxiliary speaker/cabinet. There are 1 - 1/4 inch Foot-switch, 1-  Guitar (input),1-  USB connector and a 1- small (1/8th inch  stereo?) headphone output.  Nothing on the back other than 1 - three prong AC input jack"
152,What country is it made? China?,"Yup, but so is my Shure mic. This is why our Country is going downhill."
153,"Aside from minor cosmetics and a celebrity endorsement, is there ANY real difference in sound quality/signature between the Q701 and the K701?","I can only speak to my personal experience.  my k701s are older I would say at least five years old.  Not very worn though.  they look brand new so they haven't had rough life.  my q701s are the ones assembled in China.  they both have the signature akg sound but they are distinctly different.  all I had to do was play some zedd and with the q701 not only could you hear the texture of the electronic bass it had body and oomph.   just enough.   the k701 had no lower extension at all.   the q701 sound more musical and fuller without that hardness of the k701.   Sometimes I feel the k701 has a better Soundstage but that just might be a difference of hours used.  My amp is a little portable amp but I think both would sound world's better with a really nice tube amp.  but in answer to your query in my case yes they sound very different.   In fact I was shocked how different.   But remember my k701s are of a very different vintage.

154,Will it play back your recording at slower speeds like 1/2 speed?,"I think it will, you can slow down music on as card so as long as you record first I would think you could slow down don't know what speeds, manual is online somewhere"
155,Is the case sturdy enough to also carry a music folder and flute case inside?,"The case is sturdy, but the  main part of the stand fits in there pretty snuggly and once you add the base it is a tight fit.  The folder would probably fit just fine but I don't think the flute would fit in the case.The main part of the stand is very heavy and quite substantial.  Obviously this is a good thing from a quality standpoint.  But it is a very heavy stand.  I have been thinking about trying to get a different case simply so it has a shoulder strap and is a little easier to move around.  But then again, I am also lugging a bassoon."
156,does it comes with the cable that can connects to my laptop?,"Yes, it comes with the regular USB cable."
157,is this a steal string electric guitar?,yes
158,I have this plugged in properly to my PC and the keyboard but there is no connecting.  whats the deal?  is it not working or am i missing something?,Are you sure you don't have the cables reversed? Try switching them anyway and see if you get something
159,Does it buzz like the VT40,"I have found that as with any amp I have ever used, It depends on where and what....Where you are in the room and what other devices you have around that might cause that problem. Guitar model pick ups also...I use a Gibson SG w/ P-90 pick ups. Best to just move the amp around or move to a non buzzing area. Hope that helps Phil......Robbinn...PS//// I love my VT 80 and VERY happy with it."
160,do i need to buy an ilok with this crossgrade,Yes you do. Pro Tools 9 and up requires an iLok to even open.
161,Does it come with power cord?,Yes.
162,"Can the Roland A-800 Pro be used via a Sound console,without the need of a USB to a computer?","The A-800Pro is nothing but a collection of switches. There are no electronics inside the keyboard that produce any tones at all. The keyboard must be connected to a PC or an external synthesizer to produce any tones. I use the A-800Pro with a PC running the sample software and the variety of sounds is great. Many different piano sounds, organs, horns, percussion. Lots and lots of fun. Good luck!"
163,Is it possible to slow down songs in order to learn difficult lines? Thankss!!,No.  This product does nothing like that.
164,does this come with the wooden stand for the keyboard?,nope
165,Will this cover fit a Squire Affinity Telecaster,It will only fit the vintage 3 saddle bridge with the vertical sides. You'd have to change the bridge 'cause the Affinity tele has the 6 saddle bridge and no vertical sides.
166,"Does anyone know if this will work with the app ""Planning Center Music Stand""? Also does it go forwards and backwards when turning? Thnx","Yes, yes and yes! That's exactly what I use mine for. It works great."
167,Would this work for vocals?  Is it quiet enough?  Could you just run the mixer output through it?,"I imagine you could however, it is much more suitable for an instrument."
168,Weird question: Can anyone tell me if the inside of this case has any kind of unusual smell that might affect the guitar?,"I have never had any unusual odor problems with these cases.†  Larry  ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" Philippians 4:12"
169,How can I eliminate the sound delay between the A-300pro and the computer sound card?,Latency is a function of buffer size in your DAW.  Lower that and this delay is reduced (potentially to imperceptible levels with a buffer of 128 or lower)
170,I have an Asher lap steel. Wil it fit in this case?,I don't think so. I purchased my case to fit a vintage Gibson which has a shorter neck. You should probably contact Asher Lapsteel directly. They sell a hard case for their lap steels and I think they sell gig bags as well. www.asherguitars.comI hope this helps.
171,"Can only play a piano a little.  What do you use for a pedal?  Can regular ear buds like I use on my iphone work or do I need to order headsets?  If so, only want very light ones. Thanks!","I got a pedal as part of a bundle, but I seldom use it and it is not necessary for a learner.  Up to you, really.  Any earbuds will work but the jack will need a converter to fit the large-style opening at the back of the keyboard.  I have an older-model earphones that fit perfectly, but I think my keyboard came with a converter, something like this:http://www.amazon.com/Gino-6-5mm-Female-Adapter-Converter/dp/B006Z8MSR4/ref=sr_1_45?ie=UTF8&qid;=1379325993&sr;=8-45&keywords;=earbud+converter"
172,does it work with new mac osx 10.9?,"I'm not quite sure. It works on my mac, that's at 10.6. I would go to bet that it would work with your Mac."
173,"Since these are so much more expensive than the 7506's, what is the difference? I need flat response and was wondering what the price difference means","I am not trying to be flip with my answer, but its like comparing a VW Beetle to a new Corvette. The difference is that noticeable.....higher highs, mid range is dynamic,lows are right there without being overbearing....I have both headsets.....I hardly ever use the the 7506's anymore. the 7520's keep getting better as they break in. You will not be sorry if you purchase them......Roger"
174,what key is the ukelele in?,"It is a soprano Uke, strings A, E, C, and G tuned to the middle octave on a piano."
175,"How do I change the built in crossover settings, or how do I get to the crossover?",There is no access to the crossover. This is a very low budget piece of equipment. it's a low budget speaker in a box. The terminals aren't even decent.
176,Will these work on bass guitars?,"No, you want something heavier than that.  You want something more like http://www.amazon.com/Hipshot-Two-String-Retainer-Black/dp/B00829S2TM or Three String Retainer Black"
177,I was going to purchase just one unit for mono referencing but see many people buy them in pairs. Any advice which would be best?,"I prefer pairs because it makes it nice if you want to use for mono check or for stereo ""crappy real world"" comparison. it's also nice if you're in a spot where you wanna edit a little louder than normal but can't neccesarily use bass heavy speakers. plus for the price you really can't complain."
178,Does it have places to plug in extra speakers?,"I did not see any but it has too mic plugins, a usb port to record, a cd tray and screen for words, you must have a cd with the words,, unless you know the words, im still working on how too use myself"
179,"please fix info. no way a hollow stick weighs 27lbs. 52""x18.9""x15"" LOG???",Definitely does not weigh 27 pounds! I own it. It's probably 2.7 lbs
180,What does ground lift do?And when to use it? And what is coaxial in/out for? What can I plug into them? I searched through internet and did find it.,"Hi Kenny.  Ground lift can sometimes be used to reduce or eliminate 60Hz hum, caused by ground loops.  Ground loop can occur when you have multiple pieces of equipment connected to different power sources.  Most of the time you'll want this off (not lifted) unless you are experiencing hum.  Coax is for connecting similarly equipped digital equipment (only).  It's best used to sync multiple audio interfaces.  If you don't know what you need it for, you probably don't.  Hope this helps!  :)  ~ Heather"
181,The specs say it has audio in....but does it have audio out so that you can hook it up to an external amp (for performance)?,"Hey B! It has audio in, mike in, sustain/assignable jack (maybe for a pedal I guess), headphone jack, usb, sd card slot and line out L and R plugs. I use the line out to connect to my digital recorder to lay tracks. I think that's the place where you'd plug in your amp. L can be for mono and both would be stereo. I hope that answeres your question."
182,I received this purchased from you as a gift. It does not work and does not light up.,"I'm not the seller, sorry. I'd suggest looking up some installation guides because it can be a little tricky I had to buy a powered USB hub when I got mine."
183,what songs are there on the cd,"There are 150 from several genres.  Pop, sing along, religious, country.  They are songs that were popular over the years, but not current."
184,Any reason that this wouldn't work with an Android device?,The app that it works with is only for apple. Even on my iPad I could never make it work correctly. What type of application are you planning on using it for? I may be able to point you in another direction depending on what your desired result may be.
185,Can this CTK-4200 keyboard be used with a power adapter instead of batteries?,"Yes, this keyboard comes with a power adapter.  I've actually never used it with batteries.  In fact, I had to check just now to see that it will use 6 AA batteries, which I have never installed."
186,Does it have any storage for sheet music?,No. There is no storage in the bench.
187,could you please let me know the size of the package,It is about 2.5 feet by 8 inches
188,Can an External Mixer be used with these units? Such as a Behringer Xenyx 802 mixer? Or any mixer?,"yes, just run it  into the in link although it will be mono it works great.  If you need stereo you'll have to plug it into channel one and two, its not as quiet that way. I run a small Mackie mixer through the in link when I play out to have reverb,very quiet that way. If you have a stereo mixer just pan left or right and use that output."
189,"I'm considering this amp to power 4 floor monitors but I'm wondering if it will push them adequately? The speakers are rated 200W, 8 Ohm load each.","Great question.  I power one wedge per side at 8 ohms and they work okay,  maybe a bit under powered.  Taking them to 4 ohms may be good. I would think the 3000 would be perfect."
190,Does this product have a headphone jack where you can use it in private,"Yes it has a headphone jack. I bought this to allow my daughter to practice in her dorm room but you can't play more than 2-3 notes at once. If you want one, you can buy the one I have. I'll give you a killer deal on it."
191,Does this come with a full version of Serato DJ? Or do I have to pay to upgrade form Itch to Serato DJ,Eric is incorrect. I downloaded the full version of SDJ for free.
192,Are these suitable for karaoke setup?,yes
193,Does this have the keys that light up for beginners?,"No it doesn't, but is a great keyboard."
194,how tall is it,19 inches
195,Can you plug this into the wall instead of using batteries?,"I returned this product, if I remember correctly, you need buy an adaptor to plug in that was expensive and not part of the initial box"
196,Does it works with Tracktor?,"Yes, it works with any production or mixing software as a midi device. You can also download Stanton presets for Traktor."
197,In other words it's not left channel A and Right channel B..each channel is stereo?,Yes each Chanel is stereo...
198,Does it have a USB out to go to a computer?,Yes.
199,Does the Casio CTK 4200 have a sustaining pedal or is that another item to order?,No it does not come with a pedal.
200,"How do the built-in mics compare with $50 to $100 MXL, Behringer, or Audio Technica condenser mics?","They're actually very accurate mics, in my opinion.  In that low of a price range I think you'll find them to be better, however they are pretty susceptible to noise, whether it's from interference, wind (even just from moving them), or the rumbling of handling the unit while you're recording.  If you use external mics you don't get the handling noise, but the wind can be protected against with a wind screen.Despite all that noise stuff, I'm very happy with the internal mics!  You just have to be careful while handling the unit when it's recording with them."
201,How long is the Manufacturer Warranty?,"Overview  Specification  Warranty  Reviews  PackagingWarranty  1 year for parts and 3 years for labor warranty.Support  Lifetime unlimited technical support, firmware update support.Return shipping  Buyer responsible for return shipping."
202,Do Skullcandy Crusher headphones fit in this case???,It's a big case. It will pretty much fit any headphones. What you might run into is that there is too much space. I fit both my sennheiser hd 25 and big Koss headphones in it so that my headphones dont get damaged sliding around in the case. Also they added a small pouch with a zipper which is nice.
203,"How many additional single-zone pads can I connect to the SPD-SX? Only 2, or 4?","It has 2 ports for external pads.  The dual zone pads actually use a stereo 1/4 inch cable.  In theory, you could use a splitter and break it out into 4 pads split between the 2 inputs.  I have not tried this on the SPD-SX, but I know this process does work with other Roland products."
204,What color is the lining?,Black. Nice case. I bought 2.
205,"Hi, Can you tell me if the T.REX Fuel Tank Goliath power supply is compatible with the Pedaltrain Grande board?",Pedaltrain Grande Brings -  Voodo Lab Mounting brackets -  Try To Find Out If You Can Fit The Fuel Tank Goliath On Thouse same Brackets.
206,What will i need to make these lights work? I have no experience with this type of lighting.,"You'll need a 12V DC transformer to power it.  The ability to splice (crimp or solder) the power supply to the light strand.  Probably need some connectors if you need to cut this into different size lengths and string them together, depends on where you plan to mount them."
207,Is this the begining guitar courses 1-10 it does not say . I am unable to find out anywhere all help is appreciated.,"This course takes a student from such basics as holding a guitar correctly and learning the notes on the strings to the most advanced techniques.  So, yes it's for beginners and can be used by more advanced players as well because they can watch only the relevant parts."
208,Is the irigMIDI compatible for the iPhone 5s? Or will I need to purchase another adapter?,Yes but you need an adapter to connect to the 5s lighting connector.
209,are the keys weighted at all?  touch sensitive?,Not weighted. Touch sensitive but I don't recommend this keyboard. It only works with 1 of three midi cables I own. You're better off spending an extra $50 or so for an M-Audio. Only way I would recommend this is if it's always going to be used to produce in a home studio.
210,Need clarification... the images shows 2 Single Ear Hooks & 2 Lapel Mics but the title only refers to the Single Ear Hooks. What's included?,2headset mics and 2 handheld mics
211,lightning,"The newest ones come with a lightning cable, but this one does not. Looking at the Amazon page, there is a note and a link below the In Stock message, saying you can get a free lightning cable from Apogee by filling out the rebate form. There is a link for the form. You can also purchase the 30-pin to lightning adaptor and use that."
212,Can this thing sit easily on a desktop for use without a full sized mic stand?,"In my opinion it's a great product but it's a little too flimsy for a desktop set-up. You would have to prop it up with something and get a super-wide mic stand base. I plan to shoot for a smaller acoustic shield so I can use it on my desktop because I record sitting down all the time. Again, it's great product but possibly not made for desktop application."
213,One of the pictures shows multiple programmable sliders above the keyboard that don't appear in any other picture. Are they present or not? Thanks.,They are not.
214,Any one that owns this and has a hard shell case can you tell me what you are using or give some recommendations for a guitar case please.,Hi Fender makes a round neck resonator case. Easily ordered. 713-880-2188
215,Has anyone used this to tune a 5 string Banjo? Any others work with a Banjo?,"Have used it on tenor banjo, guitar, bouzouki, mandolin. It works fine on any stringed instrument. Very accurate and is one of the few tuners that will work well on the low strings."
216,Are these the right type of panels to be used on ceiling of my audio sound room to keep noise down for my upstairs neighbor? Is there better choices?,Acoustic foam is not intended to be used as a sound barrier. It will not keep sound in or sound out although it may lead to some attenuation of the transmitted signal. Foam is intended to reduce sound reflections within the room and to deaden the sound of a space. Soundproofing is an entirely different application which required floating walls/floors/ceilings and sound barrier materials.
217,"What tune is it set to? (I wanted a ""kaali 1"" tabla)","I'm not sure what ""kaali 1"" is, but the key is determined by the diameter of the dayan diameter. Here is a basic guide: 5"" = D to D#5.25"" = C to C#5.5"" = B to C#5.75"" = G# to Bb6"" = F# to A#"
218,Does the finish have a tiny splash of green with the silver or is is just silver? Picture 1 and 2 look different...,Just silver.
219,Can I remove the XLR cable from the stand?,You would have to cut the cable out. There are no covers of any sort that you could remove.
220,Will this work with iPhone 5s?,"Yes, though you may have to remove any case for the phone so the mini-plug can plug in all the way. Also, the model of adapter I'm using is for microphones that have an external power source, like a battery for a lavalier mic."
221,are the strings metal or nylon and would this guitar be a good one for a 9 yr old girl?,"My 8 year old grand daughter loves this guitar I bought her.  At that age any guitar is a little large.  The neck (for hand reach) is on the smaller size, better for smaller hands.  She plays it several times a day while singing and smiling.  Strings are metal but nylon could be used if one wanted.  Finger tips always need a couple weeks to ""toughen-up.""  Her 12 year old friend who plays in a band recommended this to Fern as the guitar to get.  Grandpa Charlie"
222,Does this guitar have nylon or metal strings?,"metal, but you'll want to change them. There not the best quality."
223,how do you use the custom DIY buttons,"●DIY (Do It Yourself) keys for static colors:On the control panel, there are 3 groups of ""Increase"" and ""Decrease"" arrows for Red, Green,Blue colors, and 6 DIY color storing keys from DIY1 to DIY6. The 6 DIY keys are preset withstandard mixed white color, end users can manual control itscolor of Red, Green, Blue, and storethe desired color effect. Operation steps:First of all, choose the DIY key, for example ""DIY2"", that needs to be changed. Press the keyDIY2 to get its mixed lights on, adjust the brightness of its color Red, Green, Blue by pressing the relative arrows of ""Up"" and ""Down"" until the desired new mixed colors or single color are realized.Then press the key DIY2 again, the selected new light effect is stored there. The factory preset is bright white, or all three sets of arrow keys all the way up. So, with your light on, aim the remote at the infrared node, and hit the red button, to ensure your remote is working. Then hit the DIY1 button and it should turn white, now use the down arrows to start changing the color, you probably have to hit them 10 times before you see a significant difference. Then you will see the new hues coming out. You can make your own custom hue by hitting the arrows until you like it. Then just press the DIY button once again. Now you have a new stored color. But if you accidentally hit the DIY2 instead of DIY1 when setting DIY1, it will reset to just white again. Hope this helps.

224,"Will this work with Shure WL185? The Shure RPM626 claims to be compatible with it, but you don't have that model listed in your specs.",I'm using it with a 184 and it works perfect.  The 185 is the same mic just different polar pattern. It will work fine.
225,This uke comes with padded bag? Thks,"No it does not. Just comes in a box. If you are looking for a bag, you would have to purchase one separately."
226,Does this model have back light on the LCD display?,Does not have back lighting.
227,How big are the keys?,smaller than standard keyboard size: white keys-- 3/4 inch wide by 3 and 1/8 inches tall;  black keys-- 5/16 inch wide by 1 and 3/4 inch tall
228,"Can this amp be adapted to be used with ipods, mp3, or cd players etc and other external devices?","We purchased this amp for use at church, it powers the main speakers, the controls come from the Mixer Board, which has a MP3, iPod, Tape, CD, DVD, and Computer to play the audio with a great sound."
229,"Does the Traktor Pro 2 software come with it, as it says on the box?",Steven im from venezuela my english is not good Sorry. The traktor kontrol x1 comes The traktor LE. This is Dj software included
230,How can I review the songs before I buy this product?,The list of songs are on the MicroKY website.
231,"Is this an electric model? It comes up in a search for electric acuostic, but doesn't show any signs of being electric.","No, it is not."
232,Are these Lights Dimmable?,yes  they have dimmers and even wireless dimmers  for them I use both on my systems  dennis
233,why won't it turn on?,Microphone is not feeding to the machine; checked all connections multiple times and powered on and off and on and off.; have no clue how to hook up iPad; doesn't say in directions. Please help
234,Comparison request:  Nano Vypyr vs Vypyr VIP 1.   Thoughts / sound / performance / ease of use comparison?  Trying to decide between the two.  Thanks!,"I've not heard the VIP but the Nano is a pretty nice practice amp or ""hang out with your friends and jam"" amp. The smaller speaker lacks the punch and bottom-end of a 10 or 12 inch speaker (i.e. it's a little bit thin sounding) but the built-in effects more than make up for it. It's super-easy to use and has a more than a few nice sounds to dial in but you don't get the flexibility that you would with a pedal board. If you want something you can take with you on a weekend trip and jam then this is your amp. If you are looking for something that is gig-worthy (even when mic'd) or something that can project over a drummer, I would look elsewhere.

235,Can you daisy chain multiple sets together to go beyond the 16.4' length?,Waste of money they worked for three days
236,would this work for an outdoor rodeo arena?,"Hello.  This is a compact audio system and would be recommended primarily for indoor use and crowds of about 50-75 people.  It could be used outdoors as long as conditions are dry, but again you would want to use only with smaller crowds.  You would also want to consider the amount of area you need to cover with sound, as well as the existing ambient volume level around you.  We would expect a rodeo to be loud and in a large arena, so you would most likely need a much larger, more powerful system.  If you need to discuss possible options, please feel free to cal us and we would be glad to help!  Y2PLAY - 1-800-695-4808.  Thank you for your interest!

237,can turn the smoke detectors? Sticky residue on the floor? or furniture? smells the fog? contaminated food the fog?  Thanks!,"Smoke detectors:  Yes, but it takes ALOT of smoke to cause that, have fans circulating air in the room and it will help it keep from building up.  No to the sticky residue, that mostly depends upon the solution you are using.  Stick with the recommended fog and you should be fine, same for food."
238,"Are the keys touch sensitive, are they full size keys??","Yes they are, it's a full size keyboard, I don't really use it, I bought it for my brother but he loves it, he plays several musical instruments and he thinks it is a great keyboard with a lot of functions. Hope this helps."
239,would this be recommended for a 4 1/2 yr old?,"I bought this set last year for my 3 year old grandson.  He is 4 now and still plays with it, although he is quickly physically outgrowing it."
240,Does anyone know what makes this more expensive than the 2300? They look to be the same...,"Casio CTK-3200 has Touch Response and Pitch Bend Wheel on left side of keyboard.Touch Response - Let's you add delicate nuances to notes by varying how much pressure you apply to keyboard keys.Pitch Bend Wheel - Rotate the wheel to slide the pitch of the sound being output upwards or downwards. This effect comes in handy when reproducing the sound of ethnic instruments, etc."
241,ipod,Yes
242,What type of wires will I need to connect the controller to an external sound system?,You can use either the RCA outputs 1 & 2 or  the XLR out puts to a pair of powered speakers or amplifier.
243,Are thumbtacks a viable solution for installing these on walls? I don't want to leave any large screw holes that I need to fill and paint over.,Thumb tacks probably won't work.  I would use some type of double-sided tape that wouldn't tear paint off when removed.
244,What type of pickups are in this guard and where is the guard manufactured,The pickups are really cheap and the holes in the pickguard didn't line up with the squire body I had. Now it's just a part on hand for whenever I decide to do a scratch build or something.
245,The posted wiring diagram doesn't show how the pickups connect to the circuit.  Are instructions included that show how to connect the preamp?,"No wiring diagram, but it was fairly easy.  As i recall, connect the hot wire from each pickup to the balance knob and ground everything.  There are lots of generic wiring diagrams on the internet."
246,are the keys weighted?,"Yes, the keys are weighted. I bought this for my girlfriend last year and she loves it. Feels as close to a piano as I've felt as far as keyboards go. Hope this helps!"
247,will this work with win8?,Yes it should
248,"Is the max height of the Gearlux Collapsible ""Solid-Top"" Orchestra Music Stand the same 47-48"" max height as the Gearlux Delux?","The height that I measured is at 46""...that is the height at the bottom of the book holder.  The top measurement on the book holder is 59"".  So the full height of the music stand, fully extended with the book holder attached, is 59"" high.  So I'm going to assume that their max height that they list is the height from the bottom of the book holder, not the top.  Hope this helps."
249,Would the sound be efficient enough for a luncheon for about 300 people with someone speaking through a mic?,With a good mic easy. I have a cheap mic and it sounds like crap. I bought a set of Shure PGXD24/Beta58A Digital Wireless System with Beta 58A Mic and it sounds GREAT!
250,"Do I have bad Mics or bad Hardware? My Surface Pro 3, HTC One M7, and Canon Vixia HF500 won't record sound from this device?",This microphone has the screwed end on it which is typical for the Sennheiser G2 Transmitter Pack or Sony's UWP Transmitter pack.  If you are trying to plug this directly into a device that doesn't have the male portion of the screwed end the plug isn't deep enough to make a proper connection on those other devices.
251,How long is the long pocket at the top so I can buy a music stand that can fit in that pocket?,I don't have a tape measure handy but it is approximately 20+ inches.
252,Does anyone experience on the tilt axis that they are to top heavy and bounce down and now your lights are out of sync?,Pretty easy to fix just power off and on again. My issue was there was a loose screw that came off inside preventing it from moving up and down. Hope this helps.
253,"Would a 43"" guitar like the Fender FA-100 fit?","No.  The Fender is the normal thickness of an acoustic guitar.  This case is for an electric guitar or a ""thin-body"" acoustic lest than 4"" thick."
254,Does it come with a case?,Yes
255,are these small or large? I need large ones,I think they're large!
256,Rack mountable?,"Hi,Thank You for the question... The Landslide does not have an option to be rack mounted at this time.  Thanks again"
257,"Picture shows no power supply, buy converter has 5V power jack. Does it need a separate power supply?","Comes with power supply. By the way, this unit doesn't recognize codecs like those from a DVD player. It works fine for basic PCM sources like TV's, but not others."
258,Does this allow you to have separate volume for each microphone?,"Not this particular system alone, it depends on the amplifier you connect them too. Once you connect them to your amplifier, you can then control the volume of each microphone. These microphones will not work without an amplifier. But that's typical, your mics will have to be connected to a amplifier. And then yes you can control the volume of each mic. Hope this helps."
259,How do you use it with a microphone?,"This is not a good amp for a microphone but if needed you could use the acoustic guitar settings for a microphone if the mic has @ 1/4 ""jack. if you want an amp that is good for a microphone you are better off going with an amp that has 1/4"" jacks as well as xlr input wich is most common with a quality mic. I personally like the acoustic brand amps for my microphones they are designed for an electric acoustic guitar and have xlr inputs and the reverb settings work well with microphones. Peavey also makes awesome products for running microphones check out there website you will find what you need rosemary.

260,can the tempo be changed on a recorded track,"The Tempo AFAIK is NOT recorded but is simply set on the ""metronome"" which can be changed on the fly. I don't believe you can record a click track."
261,Has anyone got the MIC to work when connected to audio in via 3.5mm cable (at the bottom of the stand)? I tried to connect to PC but get no sound.,I have the same problem.... I think I returning it
262,Will these lights operate on 9VDC? Will doing so damage them?,Probably so. Although they may not be as bright. On the plus side maybe less likely to melt as mine did. Over-voltage definitely not a good idea you will let out the magic smoke that makes it work.
263,"Is the tip onthe tuning wrench a star configuration and if so is it a #1, #2, or a #3?  Thanks for your time.",It is a star configuration. I don't know the # but it fits my piano.
264,"Do I have to provide proof that I am a student? If yes, How do I do so?","Yes, the seller will send you instructions on how to submit proof. You will need to create an account with ableton to register the product, then send them a photo copy of your student ID matching the information of your newly created account. Once ableton validates the information they will fully unlock you're copy of the software. If I remember correctly the process was completed within a 24hr period for me."
265,Is this controller easy-to-use for a novice,"It's easy to use if you've used other MIDI controllers with your DAW before. The biggest thing that you'll have to learn is about mapping the individual knobs, sliders, and buttons to your DAW if you're not using Ignite which comes with it. Also getting around the HyperControl can be tricky, but Google and YouTube are your friend for that situation."
266,does this have 2 outputs for mixing purposes?,Yes - two separate channels in one box - a great mic system
267,Is there a case included with the instrument?,"Yes, it includes a beautiful Oscar Schmidt case. We have the OUWK100 in stock right now."
268,so can you only store 8 patterns on this drum machine?  and if so is the memory expandable?,It's not expandable but the human memory is virtually limitless. Embrace the ephemerality of your sequences until we reach the singularity.
269,My 10 year old wants this for xmas but I have no idea what this is! Help please!,"It's a MIDI controller. Midi controllers allow a person to interact with music software to play notes, execute commands, and perform live. Look up ""Launchpad Performance"" on YouTube and you'll see what it can do, but it NEEDS a computer/iPad(there is an app) and software to do anything. It does absolutely nothing on its own."
270,Does it come with any Cords- Wires. ?,"Yes, it does come with power cords, but you will need XLR cables or 1/4"" jacks if you choose to go that way.RegardsGeorge"
271,Can I use all my old refills like from reason 3 or reason 4?... just puttin those on a directory or is it more tricky?,"Shouldnt be too tricky, putting the files alongside the factory sound bank"
272,Does your minilabs in stock come with the latest Arturia Analog Lab software or is this older stock?,"It doesn't come with the software. It gives you instructions on how to register and download all the software you need from their site for free. That way, they aren't shipping any outdated software with the product."
273,Are there enough outputs for a 4 channel dj mixer?,"I would imagine yes, since the unit (Scarlett 6i6) has been described  as a "" 4 line outputs on 1/4"" TRS jacks, a stereo S/PDIF output, and two independent headphone outputs."""
274,Is this a better package rather than buying Image-Line Software Image Line FL Studio Producer Edition 11 (with multiple machine installations)?,"In my opinion, yes. The Signature Bundle is better for the money because it comes with a handful of extra plugins like Sytrus, Maximus, and some other very useful tools. Other than that, it is about the same as the Producer Edition."
275,"do you need to plug into an amp to hear if you re not using headphones?,,,thanx","Not really, I plugged it into my Bose sound dock II, all you need is the 3.5mm to 5.5mm adapter and your good to go."
276,Will it work with the blue snowball?,Yes! Inside the standard microphone holder is a plastic piece you can unscrew with a quarter or dollar coin. This can be screwed into the threading of the Snowball (or Ringer Mount if you have one!) to allow it to be fitted onto the suspension arm.
277,what size is speaker ?,"8"" speaker.Thank you,Adam GTRSTORE"
278,does this come with a driver.do you have connectors?,"No driver, some connectors"
279,"Do the cymbals have choke and the pads are dual zone, like the dm7x 6 piece?","Yes, the choke on the crash with the session kit as well as the snare are dual zone. The toms however are not dual-zone.Just to be clear, 'dual-zone' in this case means a rim zone and a center head zone. You can also tweak the hi-hat 'splash sensitivity'."
280,this is bluetooth for cellphones,Nope! Just a music player with an SD card slot and FM radio.it has to be charged using a USB cord
281,is the battery rechargeable,No. The battery is double AA. I changed battery after 2months. I used it often that's why. But if you will not use it so much maybe the battery will take more than 2months.
282,"My kitchen is 24ft length. I want to have the lights under the cabinets. I need two sets of the LED Sylvania Mosaic. My question: Do I need one or two A/C adapters and controllers for the whole 25ft operation. Thank you

Show Less",I strung 20 feet with one transformer with no problem.  The run of lights was actually longer but I trimed the lights with scissors to fit.  I think one is fine.
283,"One place said this case is leather, another doesn't seem to know for sure.  Is it real leather? Howstrong are the magnets and where are they placed?","Not sure about being real leather, but love the case.  Have used it for several months and it hasn't yet shown wear.  It is a little on the heavy side, but I am happy with it."
284,Will this work to record audio while simultaneously recording video on an iPhone 5s?,Yes it will.
285,will it work with xbox 360 jasper,"I think it would, it has a USB port. I havent tried that yet. I used it for my audio jack split headset and it worked well. Even though I didn't like my headset because it was a bad brand."
286,What are the dimensions from front to back.  and from side to side.,This product is 11 3/4 inches from front to back.  It is 12 1/2 inches from side to side.  These measuments do not include the separate speakers.
287,"Is it possible to have two people wearing/using microphones at once?  If so, would I need to purchase another whole set?",No. There is only one mic and one receiver. Two  systems would be needed if you have two speakers using the mics.
288,so I have a mono shotgun mic.. I used this and my output is still mono only... anyway to fix this?,"Buy a 1/8"" mono to 1/8"" stereo adapter. Should be about a buck at your local Radio Shack or for a couple bucks on Amazon. Some cords that go XLR to 1/8"" convert to stereo for you."
289,"I am still confused. can you use both the handheld and the lavelier at the same time, such as in a host/interview situation?",Yes you can use them at the same time. Although the handheld is much louder that the lavalier microphone.
290,Will this fit the AT1240 tone arm?  Is it a good idea to get a different head stock for each different  cartridge ie: one for 78s to make changing ea,"Yes, the AT1240 will work with this cartridge.  AT1240 is standard 1/2"" headshell.  Over time you will find it very convenient to have several headshells to mount cartridges for different purposes.  It takes alot of care and fiddling to get a cartridge aligned in the headshell and once you do it, it is best to leave it alone, therefore, get a headshell for each cartridge.  You just need to reset the tracking force for each headshell/cartridge, but you can mark the counterweight and spin it to the right value whenever you go from 33 rpm LPs to 78s.  The AT440MLa would likely be destroyed by a 78.  Get a super cheap 78 rpm cartridge if you need to spin 78s.

291,I started playing on a upright wurlitzer. How much of a difference is there between a upright and the PX-100? Also what size are the headphone jacks?,"The headphone jacks are 1/8"". I have no experience with a wurlitzer, so can't really compare, and in any case the ""feel"" of a keyboard is a pretty subjective thing. FWIW, I can say that this unit has a decent piano feel to me, but I would recommend getting your fingers on one to try it out."
292,"What size bells are on the wristlet?  Looking for at least 1""",3/4 of an inch
293,Does this come with the amp cable?,"No, it did not."
294,"I was told to get a pop screen with OUT metal parts on frame & screen, ONLY nylon.  Can you tell me what this frame & screen is made of? Thk ","It is made of plastic, nylon and metal. There's no problem with metal parts. This is a great pop filter."
295,does it fit a left handed epiphone les paul guitar?,The case looks universal.
296,Some reviewers said that it doesn't come with a mallet but the description says that it does.  Does it?,Mine did.
297,Is this the clear or the hazy drum head?,"There is no longer a distinction between the hazy & the clear. Unless it's an old left over clear (unlikely), if you buy the Clear, you will get the Hazy"
298,"trying to figure out how high the main stand adjusts, then how long the boom is and how wide the base span is","The main stand (with boom parallel to floor) adjusts from 16 inch to 21inch, floor to arm. The boom adjusts from 15"" to 28"" fully extended. So with the boom angled up could reach 44"" height comfortably. The base is 10"" at its widest."
299,Are the switches relay driven or hard wired to the plugs?,"Hard wired. Each rocker switch is a mechanical switch. All 4 are tied to a breaker. I used two pairs of these DJ boxes inside the stand of a saltwater reef tank where they were exposed to a high humidity, corrosive environment for 2 years with minimal ventilation, none of the 8 total switches failed but the metal cases showed a bit off rust on spots where the paint had been scratched."
300,my LP's are in outer protective sleeves (which go over the jacket) is there room on either side of the lp's when in the case??,I would say yes as there  is at least an inch or so on both sides of the los when I put mine in there.
301,Can speaker good for the karaoke,"Yes, this speaker can be used for Karaoke, PA Systems or just anything you want to use it for. I use it to play music through and practices my base and drums. Best speakers on the market, it handles highs and lows and can handle any thing you put thro-them.."
302,Is it 12 inches or feets?,That says 12 feet.
303,Will this foot switch work with a Crate DXB112 ? The amp's manual says to use a 2 button switch.,Sounds like a question for tech support.   Their website Crateamps.com
304,"will this hold a 16"" drum?","I have a 14"" snare on it now, and its tight so probably not."
305,will this fit on a rode PSA1 mic stand or is it only round mic stands?,"I think it actually could work better On a square stand, but if anything I'd be more afraid of the movement with the psa1. After a certain angle it would definitely slip out. So unless you were keeping the portion you wanted to clamp onto straight, I would be cautious with this and a psa1"
306,How does this ship when buying from Amazon.com? Does the packaging protect the guitar well so that the guitar does not receive damage?,"Yes! It is very well packaged, we had no issues at all.  Gorgeous guitar! Sounds great!"
307,what is the difference in 5A and 5B?,"American Classic® 5ATear drop tip for rich cymbal sounds. Light and fast for jazz orchestral and pit work.L = 16"" | Dia. = .565"" American Classic® 5BTear drop tip. Ideal for rock‚ band and practice.L = 16"" | Dia. = .595"""
308,This Arm support a 20-inch Cymbal?,"Yes it will, as long as it's attached to a sturdy underlying cymbol stand."
309,Are they ball end or loop end?,"ball end, making them easy to use with fine tuners. LOVE these strings--I've been using them for 30 years. They're instantly tuned."
310,"Pls is this JBL speaker  pairs or single? I mean is it two , both for this price or just one speaker?",just one
311,if i buy this item for $1.99  there would be only one pick?? or 4 picks??,There is only one pick per package. You will need to order 4 packages if you need 4 picks.
312,how long is the wire?,15 Feet
313,How do these sound compared to other Silk and Steel sets?,I like these strings -- they sound great compared to other sets I have purchased.  I would definitely recommend them.
314,Is the Shure SM93 Lavalier Microphone suitable to be used with the TASCAM DR-100mkII Digital Recorder?,"Yes. Source: http://tascam.com/product/dr-100mkii/specifications/If you look at the images, this recorder has two XLR inputs on the bottom of the unit, and it also offers Phantom Power (which this version of the SM93 requires). You can also purchase the battery unit from Shure so that you can use the battery power (a AA battery) which would not require the Phantom Power.B&H; Photo/Video has a microphone clip that is an excellent replacement for the weaker Shure one that comes with the SM93.Best wishes for much success, always!Ray"
315,how does it work without the cartridges and do the cartridges have actual songs on them,"Hi. I don't use the cartridges at all, although I believe they do have songs on them. You have many sound choices and I generally choose piano chords. I sing with children with this instrument, in pre-schools. You can choose the chords and it is pretty easy, although I still need a piece of paper to tell me what to play. You can also just have fun with chords and strumming. I like it a lot! Good luck!!!"
316,Do guitar pedals fit well on this while staying in the 2 rack spaces?,No. This shelf is too thick for guitar pedals (or much of anything) to fit in 2 spaces. You'll have to leave an extra space or two empty above it. Here's a better one:http://www.proaudiostash.com/product/19-inch-racking/rack-shelves/sliding-shelves/2u-19-sliding-rack-shelf/142.shtml?utm_source=PAS+USA+R1194%2F2UK-SL+Discount&utm;_campaign=PAS+USA+R1194%2F2UK-SL+Discount&utm_medium=email
317,How many picks does this hold?,Depends on thickness of the pick. I've got different thickness and have a few of these for each guitar. The really thin ones I've got 10-12 and then for the thicker picks it holds about 5-7. This is a great product especially for the price.
318,what is the difference between slinky and non slinky?,"Short answer: marketing. For the real story see the Ernie Ball website, but if you trust my memory... many, many moons ago there were few guitar string makers and they pretty much made the same thing- strings that helped a guitar be heard in a Big Band environment. The Ernie Ball company was one of the first to start marketing ""boutique strings"" that were easier for the player to fret and to bend. Compared to other strings at the time (anybody remember Black Diamonds?) the word ""slinky"" pretty much described how they felt."
319,Does the 30 ohms have the same bass output if it is connected to an amp compare with the 250 ohms?,"So the resistance (Ohms of the headphones) tells you how easy it is to drive the speakers (produce sound). A higher ohms indicates that it is harder to drive the speakers; that being said that higher ohms means that the sound quality is better because there is less garbling of the signal. 30 ohms is standard and is appropriate for basically anything (mp3 players included) the 80 ohm can work with mp3 players but should have a amplifier, the 250 basically is useless without a good amp... if you want to get an amplifier  I recommend the Fiio E11 portable amp (approximately 70 USD). Even if you get the 30 ohms DT 770 I am sure you will like it; I recommend getting an amp and higher ""ohmage"" if you want your music to sound just a bit nicer

If it doesn't work, wrap it with something to protect the threads and use a pair of pliers to unscrew. If top of the adapter is high enough than 3/8 screw, use a kind of blade to use it as screw driver, using two notches. I hope this would be a help."

The Xitel INport works fine with MAC. 1) You need to just plug in the INport. 2) Select it in your ""system preferences > sound > input"" the INport  (if you don't see INport as an option then try plugging it in again, or restarting your mac)3) Then install and audio recording app like ""Audacity"", and make sure that in this app's preferences that INport is selected. (note that if INport is not showing up or you don't see the volume levels reading audio from the input, you might need to restart your mac)Enjoy!"

338,Can someone explain? I'm a newbie..So does a preamp make your mic signal louder? So vocals would be louder without Clipping? thank you,"Michael, A preamp depending on who makes it can do several things. It can boost the original microphones output gain to make the signal strength louder (stronger voltage wise) to the board or tape machine or wherever your connecting it to; It can make your specific type of microphone sound like another type of microphone. If your using a mic that needs phantom power it can act like a power supply supplying the 48Volts for the microphone to operate. Like a battery in the flashlight does for the bulb. It also can give you equalizer capabilities that aren't there with a straight signal from the microphones output so you can eq/contour your sound; and overall different types/styles of manufactured microphones sound different when they react to the sound pressure levels of the sounds they are picking up (air pressure in the envireoment being converted to an electrical signal so you can faithfully reproduce what you are putting the mic in front of (in your room ambient sounds/ Audiance applauses, yells, etc,.. people walking across the stage say in a play. So I hope that helps. I'll defer to anyone else who may have input for you. Overall, good success to you. Respectfully, R.E. Sliger ASCAP

That is what I do on my laptop."
348,Has anyone ACTUALLY hooked up mor than 10 pads to this and it worked?  Is it possible to hook up 15-20 DIFFERENT pads/triggers using TRS cables?,"Yes, but with one catch - If you have the snare and bass drum routed to the same input, you wont be able to hit them at the same time and have them both register. Perhaps if you paired up pads that would be less likely to be hit at the same time... but in my experience, playing drums really doesn't work like that..."

Impedance is the measurement of electrical resistance. Low-Z is a type of signal, and an XLR cable is used with it to connect the signal. A low-Z is usually 200-600ohms, and should be paired with the appropriate 200-600ohms wires. A Balanced cable is a cable with 2 conductors (wires) and 1 shield (braided mesh wire surrounding the 2 conductors).XLR's are balanced, Low-Z cables.TRS cables are often balanced.

Show Less","You can use a Compressor pedal, Boost pedal, or Distortion pedal in front of the Spider Jam going into the guitar input even though it has it's own distortion channels. When I use a distortion pedal in the guitar input I always make sure no matter which channel I use that it's set in a way that it's clean so that all or most of the distortion is coming from my pedal and not the Spider Jam. You can also do the same thing going into the Aux input which has it's own independent EQ, Compressor, Reverb, and Delay settings. This makes this combo amp very versatile. I also use the HD 500 Pedal in front of this amp and it sounds great. I've been playing ""Bad to the Bone"" by George Thorogood and I get the tone I need from this amp, it's awesome, IMO. You don't have to use presets and I strongly suggest you play around with these devices and create your own patches.

It fits perfectly and is definitely longer than 23"". I would say it's about 38-40"" top to bottom. The 23"" is probably the neck length."
356,Can this record works Cd to Dc?,"I'm sorry, I have no idea.  This was a gift for someone."
357,The dimensions given don't tell the height once the stand is assembled. What is the assembled height in inches?,"The height of the stand with keyboard on top is 29.5"""
358,I need to know if this unit  incluiding a power adapter or works only by usb conection?,"No adapter included, but it works on both. You can get an adapter from Radio Shack or a thrift store, or even an old appliance you no longer use. Just make sure it's the right voltage."
359,is a power supply included?,Yes it is.
360,I saw some reviews saying that the power cord isn't standard for the US. Is it still worth getting? Did they just send them the wrong power cord?,"I live in the US, and the power cord works.  It's a nice product."
361,"Hi does this motor ball mount to a ceiling?  As in, could I plug it in to a recessed lighting fixture and run it that way?","There are several holes around the edge of the lip for mounting.

There are two speeds. On... and Off. There is no switch. You plug it in and it goes. It's super easy to install. Here's a better picture. http://tinyurl.com/l2olfsp"
362,Do I have to use batteries? Can it run off phantom power?,Batteries required
363,what does it measure length wise ?,42 in. (3 1/2 ft)
364,Is it also running on a Windows 7/8 64bit platform?,I don't think it will ever work right on any Windows NT based versions of Windows due to Win16 VB library dependencies since WinNT is pure Win32/Win64 core code (in other words even with MS ACT some stuff may never work right due to unresolved Win16 dependencies...).
365,is it left handed,No
366,What are the inner and outer diameters?,The measurement in inches is .215 outer diameter and .0815 inner diameter.  Make sure that the piece you are buying it for is center negative.
367,Does anyone know why these are cheaper then Rokit 6's or any other KRK Rokit speaker?,"That is a great price but you have to compare apples to apples.  There are different series that have different components like ""glass aramid fiber"" compared to ""kevlar"" for the subwoofer cones.  Also, the amps are different and (believe it or not) the higher end speakers are HEAVIER so that they do not transfer sound waves through their bases or surrounding materials.  I highly recommend that you also consider IsoAcoustics ISO-L8R200 - Large, Pair Isopacoustic monitor stands.  I had ""MoPads"" and thought that they were good.  It is downright amazing how well all of these components work.  If you have the room, buy the 8's.  I have the attenuators only up ""3 detents"" for normal use as nearfield monitors.   Only if you have a very large studio and want serious thump, go for the 10's.  In any amplifier, you always want to have more power than you need to use.  The amps are cleaner, run cooler and  last longer.  Also, invest in good acoustics for your studio as well otherwise you will never get an accurate representation of your music.

I don't think it works with Skype unless you were using a Sony video camera for your conversation, which would seem to be a big mess to me. Better keep this with the camera itself. Sounds great in that regard."
386,What size magnet?,"I can guess that the magnet is about 50 0z because I have pushed them with about a thousand watts, but not to hard. The real peavey is the SP 5 scorpion and they shake with just about any power."
387,never played one but have heard its got a great history...can it cover AC/DC and 80s Metal as well as some British Blues?,"That's what it does best, as far as the gain channel goes. The range that it covers without much tweaking is between the Clapton style overdrive and say, Judas Priest style 80's metal. More subtle than that and you'll need a boost in front of the clean channel (which it actually handles well). If you want something more brutal, stick a pedal in front. Just remember that it's a 1x12 combo and not a thiele cab."
388,I have a couple Crown 4002 XTi amps I want to mount in a case. they are 14 inches from to back mounting brackets . how well do they fit this case?,"It is simple: The Gator case I have is 16 inches long from the front to de rear, I have placed there a Crown 2500 watts (Two rack spaces) which is as long as yours and fits good in it. It is a 4 rack spaces case and after my Crown inside the case I still have two more spaces for some other items to carry."
389,can i add mi digi 003 rack + to it and add 8 channel,I do know you can not hook two of the same units together using firewire.
390,Where is the headphone jack located? Does the headphone chord get in the way while playing?,The headphone jack is under the console on the left. There are two sizes to pick from. The headhphone cord never gets in my way. That's one of the things I like about this piano. Good Luck!!!
391,Can I play Super CD+G's in this player?,"Yes and the machine not only works pretty well but can be used as a DVD player. The only thing I can't figure out is how to use a  flash drive in the machine. I download onto the drive, plug it in and can't get the words to show up on the screen. They have been no help with my issue. So the machine works well, customer service not too much help though,  I would still recommend it."
392,how many decibels can the L1 put out?,"I'm not sure why people say Bose don't like to talk about decibels or watts, perhaps people selling Bose don't, because you actually have to understand what it means. One reason I took so long to buy a Bose L1 Compact was because my hype detector sounded when music shop assistants said it broke or suspended the laws of physics - nothing does. Search ""Bose L1 Compact technical data"" and you can download a pdf from Bose which gives the dB output as 106 continuous, 112 peak, the wattage as 130 RMS at 0.1% distortion plus other info such as the input gains.To compare, you have to think more like a hi-fi geek than a pub muso. Output depends on amplifier watts,  speaker efficiency, signal match and the frequencies at which you measure it. It is quite possible to put together a 100 watt system that is as loud as another 1000 watt system. How does it compare? Well most affordable PA amplifiers I can find data for, if they give the rated output distortion at all, it is over 5% and might never perform as low as 0.1% distortion even if everything is optimal. So you can be running the Bose full out and still be getting good quality sound with distinct separation between instruments. Two examples: a noisy Irish pub on St Patrick's day about 30 m square; keyboard, drum machine, rhythm guitar, fiddle and harmony vocals all going through one bose l1 compact - clear vocals and everything else, including bass, in all parts of the pub; A school fair in a field 100 by 150 metres - a clear, full-range sound in all parts of the field, and far clearer and louder than my old 600 watt (it says so on the amplifier!) which I had to bring along because I was leaving early and taking the Bose with me. Cost? A few factors: it's cheaper than my amateur photographer friends would expect to pay for a camera and a couple of lenses, than a hif fi enthusiast would pay for a system just to listen to, never mind earn from, than just one of the drummer's kits and any of the guitarist's or bassist's guitar/amp combinations, never mind pedals. I bought my car with the old 6 (relatively small) box PA/monitor system in mind, if I had the Bose then, I could have bought a significantly smaller, cheaper car. I keep my pub duo partner's keyboard at my house and can now load/unload Keyboard, guitar, lights (KAM Partybar) plus cables, mic stands etc in 3 trips on my own, fewer with help. After midnight post-gig, that's worth every penny. The adage goes ""Small size,  good bass, cheap price - you can only have two out of three) I've used the Bose for bass guitar, to the satisfaction of big and small band members. My relatively cheap, relatively old Casio stage piano sounds more like a piano than through any other amplifier. And now I spend more money and energy on music, less on gear.Caveat - because of the quality, what you put in is what you get out, you will need your playing and microphone technique in shape to sound your best. Because it combines foldback and main function, singers are pleased to hear themselves well, but some instinctively back off as they are used to balancing their vocals through indistinct or non-existent foldback. Although with adaptors or cables you can plug up to 6 line signals in - you can use all the line inputs simulaneously and I have run a mixer into the XLR mic input with no problems - it only has one mic input. If it had even a simple 4 channel mixer I wouldn't need to use an external mini mixer for almost all my gigs. I did also pick up a simple inexpensive 3 way passive XLR combiner which made some gigs simpler.Personally I think a Bose compact and a decent mic should be the minimum any singer should have, especially if they also play an instrument. I think two would probably do for up to 250 people (or up to 500 for conference hall settings) in all but the most raucous settings and be less hassle than an L1 and separate bass bin. One makes an effective sidefill monitor. There are cheaper systems and I would never recommend that anyone spend money they don't have. The ones I have seen are either heavier, lacking in bass or clarity, and/or needing extra stands or cables. Trust me, manufacturers of cheaper gear can be far more obscure about specs than Bose and my ""adventures in making do with cheaper gear"" could fill a slim book.

393,"Does the wire have memory, ie, is it hard to straighten?",It is easily straightened by clamping one end in a vise and twisting 3-4 twists per inch with pliers or vise-grips while pulling it straight.
394,Does the neck have a truss rod?,yes it does have a truss rod......
395,Is this strap lock and the Schaller interchangeable? If I have Schaller locks on my strap will they work with the Fender button and visa versa? Thanks,Yes they will!  I interchange them on a lot of my guitars... The products are identical except for logos.
396,Can the delay and chorus/vibrato be used independently; only delay or only chorus/vibrato?,"Yes, the instruction booklet comes with a diagram with six sample settings. Delay, Chorus, Vibrato, Self Oscillation and Reverb-like Delay. The Delay and Chorus come through stronger than the reverb and vibrato, but all can be adjusted to pretty much accomplish the sound your after. It takes some time to learn what knob to adjust, and I keep the diagram handy as an aid. Still, I feel its the best choice for the price. Hope this helps."
397,"What is the difference between all the frequencies? N1 to N4? I just need to use as a fitness instructor. Also, Does this system hook up to speakers?","There are actually five frequencies, a seperate one for each microphone in the same venue.  If you are only using one microphone, it doesn't matter which one you use.  This will hook up to a powered speaker, but will need an amplifier for an unpowered speaker."
398,Is this better than the line6 pod or similar-ish?,"Everybody seem to think that virtual amplification is less. In my opinion if you spend the time you'll get what you need with this unit. Its the best bang for the buck and easier to use. The tone of the V amp 3 is much better than its predecessors. It actually does a great job of articulating your playing being what it is. Its still not a tube amp but only a super tone snob could tell. You can do anything with it. Get a FCB1010 to go with it and look into a Ureaka E prom upgrade. I'm a thirty year veteran of guitar, bass, and a live sound man doing local circuit. you wont be sorry at a third the cost of line 6.

399,Is it tuneable? Can you adjust the pitch?,No
400,does it need  a receiver,The system includes one transmitter and one receiver.
401,How long does one cushion last and does it leave a film or stickiness on the mouthpiece when removed?,"Mine last for approximately 2 months, when removed it only leaves slight bits of stickiness round the edges of the cushion that are easily removed with water and a mild detergent. I am in the habit of cleaning my mouthpieces thoroughly in water with a mild detergent using a Q-tip for gently rubbing spots of dirt before I apply a new cushion, so that ensures the mouthpiece is perfectly clean. Hope that helps."

Show Less","That guitar will tune fine if you do it correctly. However they don't stay in tune as long as a full size guitar. I'm guessing its an electric guitar. Take the plug, plug it into the guitar jack and the jack on the tuner. The cord to do this should come with the guitar. I'm going to tell you how to tune it in Standard EADGbE tuning. Pluck the first string (the thickest string) and you will get a sound. Slightly turn the tuning pegs no more than a 1/4 turn around as you pluck the guitar string, keep turning the tuning pegs slowly (again, as you pluck that string) until the tuner says E (this tuner will say 6E). After that go one string down, each gets progressively thinner, then keep plucking and turning the tuning pegs until it says A (tuner will say 5A). Keep doing that, turning the peg to tighten the correspomding string for the next 4 strings, going to the smaller string each time for D, G, B and E (E is what the thinnest string will be tuned to.) Again, thickest string to thinnest (top to bottom) you will want E-A-D-G-B-E. Use the little green light in the middle as youre tuing so you know you're on key and getting exactly the sound you want. Some guitars only do it so well, so don't be bothered if you can't get it 100% correctly and just do it the best you can. M

404,Is this device compatible with Adobe Audition? Thanks.,Yes
405,Can the violin be played without being plugged into anything?,"yes, its also acoustic"
406,I'm trying to figure out whether this is an analog pedal or a digital pedal?,It is digital. It uses Composite Object Sound Modeling (COSM). This link may help: http://www.bossus.com/boss_users_group/article.php?ArticleId=1319I own one that I use for my Suhr Badger. I'm very pleased with the tone. It compares favorably with the spring tank reverbs in my other amps with the advantage of being more adjustable.
407,Was this guitar made in the USA?,China...  not good quality
408,"This has two XLR inputs. But when you record on a computer, will you get both inputs on separate tracks? I want to put two mics on one acoustic guitar",You can but it defaults to recording stereo. On something like garage band it is as simple as changing the input from stereo to mono and then that opens up a second option for a second input in mono.  This is a great little interface. I use it regularly.
409,what's inside the box? Does it include the shock mount ?,"actually includes a hard mount, like this... MXL MT-001 MT001 Hard Mount"
410,this microphone is it low on feed back only one review need more,It is very low on feedback. The problem is you must have it very close to your mouth for it to pick up.
411,"Is this compatible with fl studio, are you able to record your drums easily in fl. Thanks",Yes.  You need to put it on bank b and then it will pick it up.   YouTube it there's tons of videos
412,"Opened and set up guitar last night (adjusted truss rod and tuned) but I can't get rid of a fret buzz around 13th fret, any opinions?","I got this guitar for my boyfriend and he told me he was having problems with a string not sounding right, which may be the same issue you're having. He took it to guitar center and they said the guitar was just cold and dehydrated. With this crazy winter, they said a lot of guitars were having this problem. We put it in a room with a humidifier for a few weeks and it's back to normal."
413,The picture you or Amazon show for the product are two stands constructed differently.  which are you selling?,"The stand showing the front of the cello. Love this purchase. Very well made and sturdy for cello, plus a place to hang the bow on the back."
414,Can these be cut?,"Yes, roughly every three Diodes.  There is usually a little line and a pair of scissors marking where you can cut it."
415,Can you plug earphones not to bother the neighbors?,"yes you can use headphones,thank god im the only one that can hear me.lol"
416,Is it compatible with korg sp100?,Yes
417,What are the dimentions please ?,I need the dimensions also -- and 6.8 x 6 inches must be made for the biggest ears the world has ever seen -- makes no sense at all!
418,where is this manufactured?,"The Korg Sound on Sound was manufactured in Japan. I was told by a salesperson on a different website that production ceased earlier this year. I was able to get one directly from Japan sold through Amazon around April, 2013."
419,Are these hard thumping speakers,No.
420,Will it work through my line six amp or do I need to use the fbv as well. Only asking because my boss pedals do not work as well through my line 6,"Yes it will, I have a Spider 15 Line 6 and my Boss pedal (Distortion) works fine on it. I can help you solve the problem of Boss pedals working better on it. What kind of guitar do you have and what kind of pedal?"
421,"If I buy this I'll be playing with it an Orange Micro Terror 20 watt head. With this head, how loud could I get?",The Orange Micro Terror 20 w is a powerful hybrid amp (tube and solid state).It will be loud enough for a small gig. For a big gig you will need to mic the cabinet for more volume.
422,"Does the wire have memory, ie, is it hard to straighten?",It is easily straightened by clamping one end in a vise and twisting 3-4 twists per inch with pliers or vise-grips while pulling it straight.
423,Does this offer include warranty?,"Yes... Tascam provides the warranty, Something like 3mos parts and labor and a year of parts only.  Saves you some dough in a tight spot."
424,Does it come with rack mount brackets?,yes it does.  But I put mine in a nice Odyssey case instead.
425,How is it powered? Can it use 110 V or 220 V either?,"It is powered via USB 2.0,  which can be done by plugging into the laptop USB"
426,can you attach a strap to this guitar?,There's a strap peg on the bottom of the body.  I just ran a shoelace above the nut and used that to tie on the top of the strap.  Works fine.
427,I'm left handed. Is this a right handed guitar,Yes it is
428,what is the differance between the dm10 and dm10x. i have studdied and cant find a big diffrence,"Different rack.  Snare has its own stand.  Drum size on dm10x are 3 10"" & 2 12"" pads.  Dm10 is 3 8"" & 2 10"" pads.  Brain is same."
429,Can someone give me the measures on the block? I really wouldnt like to have the block standing outside the cavity.,"I bought this to change a rusted up bridge on a 92' strat, the block was about 3/16'' too deep and 1/16th wider than original block, the tremolo holes do not line up if you decided to use original block with it."
430,Is this a hard case?,"No, but it is padded."
431,Is this more comfortable than the kind with just one ear hook?,It seems to sit better by holding it's place when moving around.  Comfort is hard to answer as it is subjective.  My 9 year old daughter can dance around with this and it seems to stay on.
432,will it fit a sl 1500mk2 tonearm,Absolutely.
433,Can anyone comment on how well this would work for a music-only sub in my partially finished basement? Or should I get a Hsu/Rythmik?,"It will work great, but if your neighbors are to close they will complain. I sometimes turn it on in my garage and it shakes the whole house."
434,Can I use this with my DJ console as amplifier?,No this can be used as a preamp but it doesn't provide any power to your speakers. Passive speakers require seperate amplification. This takes your signals into different inputs and one output to your speakers. If you have active speakers then you dont required amplification because it's built in.
435,Does this have a gloss finish?,yes it does
436,what are the advantages/disadvantages of having that left part of the body missing? because there's another model that's whole - what is the point?,"Honestly, I don't think there is any significant difference outside of weighing a little less.  However, the cut-out allows space in the case to store a shoulder rest."
437,How many speaker outputs?,2
438,does the hardware come with it?,yes
439,Would this be a good choice for a novice drummer-age 8,"Our son got his for his 10th birthday and he loves it.  He said that an 8-year-old might just need a little explanation of the controls that are on it, but otherwise it would be fine.  There are 50 different drum kits (drum sounds) programmed into this unit, so there's lots for them to experiment with.  There are also demos that it will play for you in addition to those 50 sets."
440,Which strings should I buy as replacement just in case?,"D'Addario EJ26-3D Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Custom Light, 11-52, 3 Sets. You can buy them right here on Amazon.com at: D'Addario EJ26-3D Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Custom Light, 11-52, 3 SetsThey are just $16.99 for 3 sets. Should last you a year if you play a lot. Not so much? 3 years."
441,"I just received this today, how do I connect it and play it on my PC? I wanna use my PC not my TV to sing. Usb driver installation failed also.","The platform for this type of equipment is designed for its potential use on TV or bypassed through an audio video component system. Hooking up to a PC is the tricky part... Attach USB cable to USB port on your computer. Make sure your computer USB port works and driver is installed properly to detects it otherwise it will fail. Then connect other end of the cable to the USB port of the karaoke. Plug mini jack end of RCA cable to PC. RCA Cable plugs into ""line in"" port of PC and the other end into ""line out"".

445,"The DC power supply included with this, is it 100-240v ie can it be used worldwide? Does the stomp get hot during usage like a normal tube amp does?","Never used it outside the US, so no opinion on that.  Don't think I ever used it for longer than 2 or 3 hours, and in that case it hasn't really built up very much heat, at least nothing comparable to a tube amp."

448,Work well with serato?,Works perfect with serato.... I am currently using the SL2.
449,These are the recommended strings for my Martin 00-15M.  I'd like something warmer in a light gauge.  Suggestions please.,"Congrats on getting a beautiful instrument. The mahogany top will contribute to a ""warmer"" sound when you find the right strings, but this often involves experimenting with different types of strings. For the most part phosphor-bronze strings are very ""bright"" sounding when they first go on but lose their ""brightness"" pretty quickly. Coated strings, like the Martin Lifespan, Elixers, etc., tend to be less ""bright"" at first but have a remarkably longer lifespan before sounding dull and dead than non-coated strings. Try a coated bronze (not phosphor-bronze) first to see how that sounds to you. Also keep in mind that the lighter the gauge, the less volume and punch the strings are going to have, no matter what kind of guitar you play. You might try non coated strings, also, if you dont mind changing them more often. Ive used a number of different strings on my Martin and tend toward preferring a ""brighter"" sound, and Im usually eager to try something new, so dont get impatient, and keep notes on which strings work best for you.



    Congrats on getting a beautiful instrument. The mahogany top will contribute to a ""warmer"" sound when you find the right strings, but this often involves experimenting with different types of strings. For the most part phosphor-bronze strings are very ""bright"" sounding when they first go on but lose their ""brightness"" pretty quickly. Coated strings, like the Martin Lifespan, Elixers, etc., tend to be less ""bright"" at first but have a remarkably longer lifespan before sounding dull and dead than non-coated strings. Try a coated bronze (not...

Coated strings, like the Martin Lifespan, Elixers, etc., tend to be less ""bright"" at first but have a remarkably longer lifespan before sounding dull and dead than non-coated strings. Try a coated bronze (not phosphor-bronze) first to see how that sounds to you.

450,Would this work for an overhead light on a small stage? And how close do you have to get with the remote to adjust these lights? Thanks!,"Personally I didn't like it AT ALL as the portion of lighting area is too narrow.Surely you could as you wish but you'll need multiple units as much as you'd likeI just had returned right away, I wouldn't recommand."
451,"Is this roll waterproof like some of your others? And I'm talking the more heavy duty waterproof (rubber coating of the top), not ""indoor waterproof"".","This is definitely NOT an outdoor light strip.  It's been great in the kid's room or for something like under the kitchen cabinet.  Also, you can only link 2 strips together max with the low power supplied so don't expect to go 'great lengths'.  It's a great little light strip for the price but know your limitations up front."
452,Does the bag have shoulder straps so that it can be carried on one's back?,"Yes, it is an excellent bag with pockets for bow and other musical stuff"
453,Does it work with a Mac?,"This interface does work with a Mac! It's great because you can just plug and play. Although, you may have to open system preferences and switch to the USB interface in your audio output."
454,Is it all tube?,"No, but it sounds amazing and very similar to a tube amp. I am more than pleased with it. I highly reccomend this amp!"
455,"Looking at the dimensions of each products, I have a doubt. Does this Flight Case fits the new  Traktor Kontrol S4 MK2 ?",Yes the box is big enough for it.
456,"Does this include the microphone, transmitter? I don't see the microphone on the picture.","Yes it did, not a nice one, but it did include one."
457,"Can someone tell me, why my system doesn't work when I take out the plug. it only works when plugged to an outlet.","It's because the original charger that's built into the unit is not a smart charger. So I bought a Del Trans smart charger, then i went to radio installer and had them put a new electrical connector at the original battery to accept the quick disconnect cord from the Del Trans smart charger. Then I cut a notch into the battery door so the other end of the quick disconnect cord can be accessed. When I'm not using the PA I keep the charger plugged in 24/7. So when I'm ready to use the PA it's always fully charged."
458,"What are the internal dimensions? My Yamaha F 325 has an unusually wide lower bout (""hips"") of 16 1/4"" (16.25"").",16.25 Inches lower bout.
459,Can this be used for vocal?,"A PA system is the best choice, but a bass amp will work. You need a 1/4 plug to go into the jack input."
460,Is there a headphone jack?,"No, there not."
461,does this come with a carrying bag(with zipper),No
462,Will this fit the Epiphone G-400 PRO electric guitar?,"Yes, it fits perfectly! This is a great guitar case to go with."
463,"How long of a recording session will fit on this, and can you download it to soundcloud easy?",Depends on the size of your memory card but with the 2 gig card that comes with it probably 12+ hours at highest quality. It transfers to your computer like any other memory card or by usb. This thing is very easy to use.
464,Just received mine. Is there a way to secure the boom arm in the clamp?,"The boom arm is designed to just slide into the clamp and swivel freely. There is no way to secure it in place out-of-the-box, but I'm sure you could come up with a homemade solution"
465,Some of the reviews comment that the tape fails. Is there any other SAFE method of attaching them to a surface?,"I honestly never had this problem. What I made sure to do is that when I put up the lights I made sure that it was low humidity. Seems to me that the failure has to do w/ humidity if using it outdoors. If inside #1 that A-shouldn't be a problem and B-regardless of using it indoors or outdoors if you go slowly it shouldn't be a problem. I haven't lost a light yet and I've been using these a bit over 2 months now. Also I believe if you bring it to an electronics store like Best Buy and buy some double sided electrical tape that's thin and about the same width that should take care of the problem safely. Don't buy masking or regular shipping tape as that is unsafe. If you have other concerns I'd contact Tao Electronics directly as they're very helpful and their email support is open 24/7. Hope this helps you out.

466,"Are they wooden sticks, if not what are they made of?","They are wooden. I use them w/ my kindergarten classes. They take a pretty good beating, but will begin to splinter in time."
467,How long is the cord?,"Quite long; around 8-10 feet. From the product page: ""Diameter 6.3mm plug and it is 8 Ft long"""
468,Is there two speakers in a package or just one?,Just one.  They usually run between $90-$115 depending on where you buy them.  They are super loud for the price.  There is not much on the low end but we use these for our entertainment business.
469,the discription below says it comes with two microphones. the top discription says only one? which is it. thanks,I have bought this article and it comes with only one microphone of poor quality
470,can you add additional receivers to this transmitter?,"Yes, just match the channels and you are set."
471,will this work with this GTD Audio G-622H 200 Channel UHF Professional Wireless microphone Mic System,"I'm thinking it would, altho that's not exactly what it's designed for. Usually placed between the mixer and mains amplifier. Between the mic receiver and the mixer would theoretically work methinks. If the mics are not to be used on stands, you'd have to test them in various positions around the stage which will create different frequencies of feedback. Anti-feedback devices are little more than EQs with very narrow band filtration. I'm guessing your success with this will vary significantly from venue to venue. Good luck!"
472,can you use the usb with audacity and if so does it need software to do so?,Yes you can.
473,wanted to know if the saxophone is Japanese,"Yes, this saxophone is Japanese Maria. Thanks."
474,Adjustable truss rod in this guitar?,"Yes.  Great guitar by the way.  Dollar for dollar, the best in my collection!"
475,Can it be played without the keys lighting up?,"Yes, in the Casio LK165 user's guide, it tells how to turn key-lighting on and off.  I hope this helps.  Have a great day!"
476,will these work for a ukulele?,"I used mine to hold my ukulele, and it works fine. The hooks can be turned so that they will fit all sizes of instruments."
477,Does this work with the Blue Yeti Pro?,"According to Blue customer support, they're redesigning these shock mounts. They recognize that these don't support the weight of the Yeti or Yeti Pro correctly.I've been told that it'll be four to six months before my broken one will be replaced by a new one.  It sucks to have to wait for a new one, but at least het acknowledge that it's broken in its design.I'd hold off on buying this, at least until they retool the design."
478,willl this amp power two behringer vp2520s?,"Yes this amp with those speakers is a reasonable match the inuke 3000 will push 800 watts . If you back off the limiter about 1db you'll be at 600 to 700 watts and protect the speaker as well. I run mine on two 225 watt 8 inch speakers crossed with a 50 watt tweeter (450hz and up) for my upper mids and highs and it runs very well. I personally wouldn't expect a lot of low end response from your combination but I push my speakers really hard. With an inuke 6000 on 2 15s each side crossed at 125 to 450 and another inuke 6000 on double 18 each side  from 40 to 125. However this will do a football field in a very small speaker footprint.  Hope this helps.

479,Does ukulele have aquila strings?,"Yes, it came prestrung with Aquila strings."
480,How close can these be placed next to a computer? I have small desk.  One of them would have 2b right up against case. Would hard drive &etc. be safe?,"The only time you have to worry about proximity with speakers is with the old fashioned CRT monitors.  LED screens aren't affected by speakers.  Hard drives are safe.  I have one of my speakers right next to a Drobo raid array and it's never had a problem.  It takes quite a bit of magnetism very close to the platters before you can really harm a hard drive, and the field from the speakers would have to penetrate the computer case and the protective shielding around the hard drive."

Show Less",I received the stand today. Surprisely it came with an extra set of rubber corners- the beefy ones. So i have both sets. I swapped them out. They seem to hold the iPad much better-very tight. I can turn the iPad upside and even giggle it without worring that it will fall out.
482,Does it come with Traktor or Virtual DJ??,Comes with traktor LE NOT the full version.
483,Could I plug this into a Video camera and use it as a microphone? or would I have to sync the separate audio to the video later?,"So long as your camera has an outlet for it, the H2N has the ability to do so."
484,"Do these fit the ""Blue Parrot"" XT250 Bluetooth Headset Microphones?",yes but they are a little bit bigger but still fit anyway.
485,Will the Audio Technica AT2020 Microphone be held by this stand?,"Any mic within 1 1/8"" diameter."
486,Can you turn off the lights on the keyboard?,"Yes, you can.  You just hold down the Function/Key Light button on the bottom right, then push the (-) button in the number pad until the screen reads Keylight off.  Push the (+) to turn them back on."
487,Would it be possible to make compilation C.D.s and if so is it difficult? If it is possible is the finished C.D. playable in your average C.D. player.,This Duplicator only copied CD's or DVD that have already been created. If you create a compilation CD on your computer then this machine can make copies of that disk.We use it in a church to copy our services to send to our shut in members.
488,Can I assign my own sounds to this?,No you cannot. unless you hook it up to your computer and use it as a controller. That is the only reason i returned this device. Otherwise it is awesome.
489,How does this compare with a Pigtronix Infinity Looper or a Boomerang III in terms of signal fidelity? I've heard some boss loopers suck tone.,"I've never used either of the system's you've mentioned, but I run my RC-300 at the end of a LOT of input; POD HD 500, Elec. Keys, Elec. Drumkit, a handful of various analog and digital stomps (Boss and Behringer primarily-Reverse and Delay), and a Digitech Loopman. All of this is simultaneous, and I can't say I've lost any tone whatsoever, and believe me, there's some crazy amounts of variety in frequency as well as modulation that go together at once. You honestly have no worries with this piece of equipment. However, you WILL LOSE TONE without proper amplification and cables. You'll need to consider spending a pretty penny on some quality powered speakers and sturdy cables if you want to preserve your tone. I've been running a standard Fender FM100 Stack for a while and it cuts all of the bass from the kit, keys, and effects, as well as adds too much treble to the snare and higher registers. If you ever multi-link instruments with a y-cable, get a good one. I have a cheapo one right now and both the keys and the guitar/POD system have their decibel values decreased severely. Soooo... In short, you should marry this loop system.

490,hows the volume? dose it get loud and how sturdy is it,"Mine has been fine.  For the price I paid, I feel it is a good value.  Not a top flight guitar but for a beginner/novice or for a knock around guitar, good choice."
491,Once set to a color/mode is the remote control required to re-select that color if the power is removed and re-applied?,"Nope....  if these are same as they used to be, the controller ""remembers"" even when they are unplugged."
492,What kind of wood is the top made on this violin?,Spruce.
493,"This Case its for the Telecaster Thinline?  (Fender Classic Series '72 Telecaster® Thinline Electric Guitar, Natural, Maple Fretboard)",All I can say is that my 1967 American made Fender Telecaster fits in this case perfectly.
494,what strings are recommended?,I use ElixirCustom light .011 - .052Phosphor BronzeNanoweb ultra thin coating
495,Whats The Difference Between The Pioneer DDJ-Ergo-Limited And The Pioneer DDJ-Ergo-V?,Difference is Color.  Both I believe are the same device.
496,Can you vary the volume?,"Yes.  It has 3 levels that I can see.  Also, if you plug ear buds in the mini-jack the beeping can only be heard through the buds."
497,Will this work with Sony Handycam  HD AVCHD?  I am really not sure what kind of mic input my camera has- it looks like a standard size- is it possible to get an adapter to make it fit?,"Can't say for sure, but it worked well with my Canon-Vixia. It is a straight forward 1/8"" input, like a headphone jack uses. I like it and has worked well. :)"
498,what kind of batteries does the transmitters use?,I use energizer rechargeables. Costco has batteries called en-loop. AA NiHM batteries are the best.
499,What kind of battery does the remote use?,"It uses a 12-volt alkaline MN21 battery, like these: Duracell MN21B2PK Watch / Electronic/ Keyless Entry Battery, 12 Volt Alkaline"
500,foto of rear? XLR outputs?,Yes it has balanced outputs. This is dual monaraul and pseudo balanced.
501,How long of a bow will this case accomodate?  I purchased a new bow for my daughter and it will not fit in her current case.,It will fit a full size.
502,Does this product work on the 120volt side and will it work with led puck lights,"This product used 120V AC power and converts it to 12V DC power.  It will work for any type of 12V DC device.  Beware though, polarity is important in DC devices.  If it doesn't turn on at first, reverse the wires and it should work.  Also, these transformers have a maximum load in watts.  Be sure to know the watts of your string of devices.  Do not overload the transformer.  If you need to, buy two.  That is the downside of using a lot of LED lighting devices.  They may be cheap but the transformers and additional wiring can be expensive.  Hope this helped."
503,How are the sounds in this unit? Are they realistic or cheap sounding? What sounds does it have?,"I asked my 15 year old, whom is good with music, He said the keyboard is good better than a cheap sound.but not as good as a professional unit, And the system can create  about 500 different sounds piano, drums, most instruments."

507,Can I use a locker in this case?,"no, maybe you can use special belt, but locker mmm no, I was trying it is possible, but good question, I didn't know the possibility to use a locker, because it is heavy and I use for local places."
508,Does it fit an IPAD AIR,"Ionic Rotating Stand Leather Case with SLEEP AND WAKE Functiontion - according to Apple's website, the iPAD Air is a different size than the previous iPADs.  See https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/   So I don't think that this case will fit the iPAD Air."
509,I have a CD recorder.  It has 4 plugs.  I only see 2 on this item.  am I able to record CD's with this?,"Yes. The 2 RCA female plugs are the mixers output. 2 out of the 4 female RCA plugs on your recorder are inputs. You use these. The other 2 are outputs. They go to an external amp. Not the mixer. If you wanted to hear the recording thru the mixer from the recorder, get an RCA male 2 connector to 2 (1/4"" ) plugs (like guitar plugs and run them thru 2 channels on the mixer"
510,"Does ""a set of -spare- strings"" mean that there is an additional pair or is it just the one set used to string it initially?","The erhu comes pre-stringed and includes an additional set of strings. So you get two full sets of strings. It is quite nice, comes with a tuner and various pads to suit your taste in sound"
511,I have a 6 string Sunlite Dreadnaught and I am wondering if that will fit in this bag?,"my Hohner Chorus dreadnaught guitar is 41"" in length and at the widest part across the body is 16"" and depth is 5"" and my guitar fits in the case very well and it even has room for a little movement I hope this helps you! if you have any more questions feel free to ask."
512,can these be used in vehicles? im trying to use them inside my headlights there gonna go around the outter part around the blub is this possiable,I would say no.  I don't think they would hold up between the heat from the headlights and weather.  They'd work if you were doing something inside your car...
513,"I see this set doesn't come with the hi hat stand, but I understand you can use any hi hat stand correct? It does come with the set stand",It does not come with the hi hat stand. The other cymbals attach to the drum stand. You can use any hi hat stand.
514,I am trying to run a span of 48 total feet how many repeaters will i actually need? One after Every 16 foot run?,"The power source that came with your LED roll should power up to two LED rolls (16ft each), the repeater will also power up to two (one line coming in and two lines going out (being repeated)).  If you need 48ft then you would 3 LED rolls and 1 repeater.  1st LED roll connects to the power source / controller, 2nd roll to the end of the 1st LED and the other end in the repeater IN, third LED roll connects to the repeater OUT.  You would still be able to attached a 4th LED roll to the 2nd repeater Out- if you wanted an additional 16ft (64ft total).  Hope this helps... good luck!"
515,How many pound has it?,It is very portable and weighs less than 1kg (2.2lbs)

517,Can it rotate to use the iPad in landscape mode?,Yes
518,Is the color of this stand black ??,Yes.
519,Can this be rack mounted?,"It doesn't come from the factory with rack ears.  However, it might be possible to install them if you're handy with a drill and a screwdriver - I'm sure I could probably make it work if I needed to."
520,Can we route/split 1 input (e.g. 1 mic input) into say 3 different inputs as if 3 mics all receiving the same audio source?,"Yes, not sure what your goal is but with matrix mixing or bus routing, this is possible. Actually routing it in as 3 separate inputs may or may not be possible but not really necessary given the bussing and matrix mix features"
521,So if it does not play cd's how does it karaoke?  What would I have to buy in order for my daughters to sing to music and see the words on the tv?,It will play CDs. But in order for your daughters to see the words you have to buy an actual Karaoke CD. Does this help?
522,Can it play an iPod via the USB connection and will it charge?,it can't do any of these
523,"Regarding the last question, could someone also tell me if ANY of the vendors selling this product have it packaged with software version 2.0?","Yes, it comes with 2.0 now."
524,"Hi, Is $699.99 including all the stuff in the PIC have?","Yes, it includes the bench, book, pedals, book stand!  We are very happy with our purchase!"
525,Can this be controlled to fade between the colors automatically and smoothly?  Is there a remote control for this?,Yes with a DMX controller
526,How much noise does the amp create? I'm looking for a PA amp that needs to be very quiet in a small room.,"Its loud, the fan is loud enough to hear when I am not in production....."
527,Are these true humbuckers? I ask because I have found single coils in humbucker bodys on cheaper pickups?,They are Humbuckers.
528,Will these tuners fit epiphone electric& acoustics without enlarging the holes?,"I don't know what size those holes are but it fit my fender acoustic perfectly, so I assume it will at least fit your acoustic - the screw holes are very small. Don't know if this helps.."
529,Was the light suppose to come with batteries of some sort?..I have put on charge forever..no light without plugging in,Mine did not have accessible batteries but holds a charge.  I plug it in for a couple of hours and then it works beautifully for several hours until it needs a recharging
530,So is this basically a Flashback and a ditto looper built in together? Or am I better off getting a flashback x2 and a ditto separate?,No. The best way to describe this is 3 Flashback Delays with a built in tap tempo. This unit only has 30 seconds of loop time compared to the Ditto's 5 minutes. The X4 is designed to have the extra pre-sets. There is a way to adjust the delay time (not tap but holding down the button and then strumming the tempo) on the original Flashback. Ultimately I would say the only difference between the two are extra storage banks on the x4. Ultimately your decision may depend on how much loop time you want. The other difference is the x4 has two more delay options. Hope I helped!
531,Is that all you have to do is tune it when you receive it?,"Mine was almost perfect.  The intonation was off by a pinch on the third string.  It sounded good before the adjustment, and excellent after."
532,Does the stand have plastic parts?,the knobs are a solid plastic substance. stand is very sturdy-holds a lot of music. also the base legs of the stand have a plastic cover over them to minimize metal marks on the floor. I love this stand and I think you will not be disappointed
533,What is the weight limit?,Not certain but we sat 2 190+ adults on it and it seemed very stable.
534,Will this product work if I mix it with wired dmx (daisy chaining)?,This product doesn't work in any position very bad product
535,"How thick can the tablet be? In other words, will it work if it is in a case (depending on the case thickness)?","We use ours with a Kindle HD 8.9"" and 7"" tablets, both have slim-line cases on them and work fine in the stand. Overall thickness of the device with case should not be more than 5/8"".  Thicknesses with a case between 5/8"" - 3/4"" might work but it will be a squeeze.  Thickness greater than 3/4"" you can forget about it."
536,will it it most standard lead guitars,Yes this fits standard size. I loved Ll the extra pockets
537,"If you used this with a Blue Snowball, would you mind pointing me in the right direction to what size adapter I need for this to work? Thank you.","I created my own. I used an old T-shirt wound around the stem coming from the Blue. It doesn't look too bad (no one really sees mine anyway), and may help isolate an vibrations even better."
538,"Pinoy/Pinay brother or sister:  Can we input our own background images into this new system?  Salamat, Glen D.",Oo. You can add images to this system.
539,is there a truss rod? or not.,Yes there is a truss rod installed.
540,Does this work sitting on the floor or a table or do it need a stand/ to be mounted to the ceiling?,"I placed mine on the floor with the flexible legs it came with. However, I plan to mount them on my studio's wall with the brackets it came with. I hope this helps!"
541,Hey there! I'm using iXY and Rode Rec (payed) but still can't monitor the sound by headphone. It has to be activated? Help! Tks,"If using headphones with a headset mic attached, make sure they are plugged in BEFORE the iXY otherwise they will be automatically selected by your device as the input."
542,does this amplifier work with a lap steel quitar,"As long as you can plug 1/4 inch jack into, it should work"
543,"What is the difference between the Korg KP3 and Korg KP3+?  This is a gift, and I don't have a clue.Thanks!","The difference isn't huge. Essentially the KP3+ has a few more effects built into it. But thats about the only difference between the two. Personally I use the extra effects a lot, so I would advice to get the KP3+, but it depends a lot on what it's going to be used for and if it justifies the higher price or not."
544,how fast does it go,Like a Marsupial...really fast
545,"Can the 1/4"" inputs be used for Mics or just line inputs ?",I have successfully used both.
546,"i heard that the only down this pedal has is that its a single chain pedal,why is that a bad thing?",There is no problem with this pedal. I bought mine on a referral from the drummer in Candle Light Red. This is a bad @ss pedal!
547,does it come with the microphone stand?,"Yes, a small desktop tripod"
548,Are the complaints that the preamp volume/gain is too weak a serious problem?,"Preams are weak, but not so much. It depends, which microphones we use and is it close or far micing. I cannot say that those preamps are bad. They are weaken than some famous preamps but overall they are not bad. Hope it helps."
549,Does it come with rechargeable batteries and battery charger ?,"No, it doesn't come with rechargeable batteries. You use normal batteries. I think is better because you can have a couple of backup batteries"
550,"THis stand is secure for Ovation acoustic guitar? Ovation has different box, like laúd.",One of my guitar's is an Ovation and it rest securely on this stand.
551,"I'm having trouble figuring out how to operate the 4 switch pedal! It seems complicated! I'm an older guy and just want to  go from a clean sound to pressing a switch and adding tremelo, then maybe hit another switch and adding either a chorus sound or an overdrive sound and then back again to clean sound.

Show Less",Here is a link to a tutorial on you tube...it shows the 2 button and the 4 button...I hope this will help...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeAkT9J2NK4
552,does it come with the cable?,Yes.. a midi cable that plugs into the back of the amp.
553,Does it include plastic strips? Or is it just the cutter?,"It includes the 4 plastic strips shown in the photo...though at one time the company included a coupon for a bonus set for free, not sure if that promotion is still going on."
554,Does this package include a mic clip?,"Hello Yes Original Shure Wireless Mic Clip from 8thstreet Music, Thanks!"
555,Is the price for two monitors or for one?,It is for one.
556,Does this do white?,"Not exactly. It represents white by turning all colors on, so what you get is clear light. Mine also has a red hue"
557,PAIR OF MONITORS OR IS ONLY ONE ???,"Only one monitor comes with each purchase, so make sure to order two if you want a pair."
558,Does this work with Raspberry Pi?,"Raspberry pi A has a 2.0 usb port & the b model sports 2,  as long as there is an internal sound module this device will replace the headphone & mike jacks on your units, To iterate, you must have the internal audio module in your master unit. It works well except if your constantly plugging and unplugging the mike and headphones."
559,How long was the XLR cable?,"That's correct, the XLR Cable is 20 Feet. Thanks!"
560,Can you hook up ipods to it?,It has aux in but you will have to have a 3.5 mm plug to hook up through the headphone jack.
561,"can the pulmonica, make you breathe slower, and breathe right, from the diaphram",Yes
562,Has anyone used this for vocals in an R&B band and if so how did it perform?,"I use it for vocals, not R&B;, but that should not matter. The quality of sound is really good. It picks up the bass in my voice making it sound smooth.  Your blues will sound bluesier and volume is easy to adjust."
563,Are you able to plug these lights into dimmers?,No you can't. It says in the instructions that you should never connect them to a dimmer pack.
564,"Hi does this case protect the screen? I just spent a high figure fixing the screen and I like to get a case that will protect it, thank you!",It doesn't cover the screen but does have a rubber type bumper all around the screen. This case covers the back and sides of the phone.
565,"Does the Treble, Bass, FX Level and FX Select controls work with Channel 1, or only Channel 2? Does the 40 handle pedals well, or is the 100 better?","The Treble, Bass, FX Level and FX Select control knobs on the Champion 40 actually work on both channels (clean and distortion) simultaneously. The knob settings apply to both channels (which is a slight drawback, but not the end of the world). The Champion 100 (which I also have) has two sets of these control knobs, one set for each channel independently. This means that you can have different tone and FX settings for each channel...and it comes with a foot switch to change channels and turn the effects on or off.The 40 is a good amp for practice or small gigs, especially if you mic the amp. You don't want to crank the volume above about 6-6.5 or you get distortion...it is only a single 12"" speaker, after all. But it is still a great little amp!The 100 is definitely better because it is more powerful, it has two 12"" speakers, big volume (I have yet to have the volume above 4)...and the separate tone and FX controls for each channel. They handle certain pedals very well. I use a Zoom G1N, an Ibanez Tube Screamer and a Cry Baby Wah. Both amps seem to handle them very well.For the price, they are both great amps for all that you get! And you can never go wrong with Fender!

566,Does the item come in pair or single?,Its just a single monitor Aaron. Thanks.
567,Where is this ocarina manufactured?,"Very good finish, beautiful sound, but in the high tones has some detuning"
568,"What cable do I need , my amp takes 1/4""","1/4"" is all you need. It works great."
569,Where was the guitar manufactured?,"From what I can read on the back of the headstock, it appears to have been made in Mexico...but I'm not positive.  I emailed Fender but haven't heard back from them yet."
570,will this sub rock? how is the power if pushing two top 15s,"it cant power 15"" tops. maybe 8"" tops. i wouldnt power any speaker off the sub amplifer. the amplifier is hardly powerful enough to power the sub so hooking more speakers up to it is a bad ideaany speakers you have need the be active/powered or have there own amplifier im not a fan of this sub"
571,is this also a midi controller?,"It only has a MIDI in port, however it can do limited MIDI I/O via USB. It only outputs note events, pitch bend, and mod wheel. None of the pots respond to or transmit MIDI."
572,is this a good tuner for a nube? i have another electric tuner and it is set correct 440 htz but i will get the green light and it is all wrong...  TY,"Yes, I'm also a nube. It's preset to 440 Hz and has a tuning range of 435 Hz to 445 Hz. Before I had this I was always told you're not tuned up properly even though I was using an electronic tuner. Now I don't have that problem and I don't need help tuning properly. I hope this helps you."
573,Could I plug it into my dell laptop? Is the sound quailty good? Clear?,"NO, is is NOT really compatible with a PC mic jack. This mic is designed to plug into a STEREO mic jack. Your PC's mic jack is mono. The PC mic jacks, and PC mics, have three contacts like this one does - which make many people believe they are compatible - but on the PC the contacts are mic, +5 power to the mic (this is why PC mics don't need an onboard battery, they get power from the jack), and ground. Not left, right, and ground as on this mic. It might ""work"" but it will not give you stereo sound and you will get sound from the mic's left side only."
574,Does this 5oz can of DeoxIT D5 come with a precision spray tube?,Yes
575,I am looking for an adapter that will convert my old Microsoft Keyboard 6 pin connector to a USB connector to fit in my new computer. Will this do it?,No - this is for attaching music devices.  Try this instead:  SANOXY PS2 Keyboard To USB Adapter
576,Is it Negative or positive?,Positive. Worked just fine with my older Casio Privia piano. Hard to find.
577,Will an Ovation Elite 2778 AX fit in this case?,"Yes, it will fit any deep, mid depth or contour bodies."
578,How wide and thick is the neck? Would it be ok for someone with small hands?,"definitely! I did not measure but to me especially this one sold by amazon, the neck is thinner and than the old epiphone which has the c shape instead of d shape.  And it is lighter than the original one."
579,will this work on an ATR2100?,"No, the barrel on the 2100 is too big. I had better luck with the On Stage MY-420 Studio Microphone Shock Mount."
580,Is this gig bag for a Les Paul and is it padded?,"This bag was a perfect fit for my Les Paul Special II. I am able to zip the case shut with my shoulder strap still attached and tucked in the back. There is some padding which could be a little thicker, but since I don't lug the guitar everywhere I go, it suits my needs just fine. One thing I also liked about this case, was the front compartment is able to hold my amp cable as well. For the price of this case, I believe I got my money's worth. I hope this answers your question."
581,Will these reduce the noise associated with a computer server? I have a server which gives off a lot of hard drive and fan noise. Will these help?,"No, not significantly. This foam is for reducing sound reflections off of walls, etc..  It's not intended to be used for sound isolation / sound proofing. However, if you isolated the server in some kind of box, the foam would have a very mild dampening effect.Soundproofing demands materials with a lot of mass (foam like this doesn't have much at all), and decoupling (distancing)  two layers of material so vibrations aren't easily transferred.You could look into building a drywall box to enclose the server. Green Glue (a sound dampening compound) is an effective and relatively inexpensive way to soundproof drywall. Both SILENTFX and Quiet Rock are multi-layered drywall with built in sound proofing (essentially these are ready made versions of the above DIY Green Glue + drywall).Another way to soundproof a box is to line it with material like MLV (mass loaded vinyl: expensive but very effective), or a rubber mat (the heavier and thicker the better).Sound absorptive materials like sound curtains, acoustic blankets, insulation, mineral fiber, and StudioFoam (to some extent) could be used in combination with a box, to provide varying degrees of of additional sound dampening. However, these materials are not very good at isolating noise or sound proofing in and of themselves.

      « 

Show Less",I completely understand your logic I'll let me help explain. The entire dinner is 20 A maximum. Each channel can handle 10 amps each. For example you can put 10amps on channel 1 and 10amps on channel 2 but if you put any more load on channel 3 or 4 the entire dinner will be overloaded. This allows flexibility if you want more or less loads (beyond just 5amps)... Within the 20amp max total.Hope this helps.
603,Will the B1 fit into a universal shock mount 43-50mm?,"My Behringer B-1 is about 48mm in diameter half-way along the centre of the shaft. I have also read in comparisons that it's about the same size (as well as a similar shape) to the Neumann U87, so I guess it would be a safe bet that it will fit.It would be wise to use a different shock-mount, because the Behringer one that is supplied with the microphone is an awful design with thin elastic that gets sloppy and falls off, causing the whole structure to collapse."
604,"Can this stand support a 12 lb. iso filter, as well as a Blue Yeti microphone?","This is a sturdy stand, but 12 lbs may be better used on a tripod where you can apply a leg to the side where the weight is."

Stephens' advice and enter the part number she gives on the website she points you it will show a picture of an ATN3600L stylus.  The ATN3600L is the most common stylus of entry-level turntables."
614,Can this mixer be used with the PYLE-PRO PDWM4400 - 4 Mic VHF Wireless Lavalie/ Headset System,It works with any wireless systems.Does that help?It works as good as any mixing board.enjoy it if buy one
615,Does it come with a stand or an XLR cable?,Nope.
616,"To block noise from entering my room, which side of the door do I put this on?","This will help prevent reflection of high frequencies but will not do much for lows or vibrations. The best thing to do would be to put a layer of something heavy like dynamat or a mat with a built in sound deadening layer. And the best place to put that would be the actual inside of the door. In other words, if it is a hollow door, take the thin sheet off of one side so you can see the inner workings of the door, and put them on the inside so that when you put the sheet back on you can't see anything you added. If you really want to use this, you could put it on the outside, facing the source of the noise.

617,"Can you unscrew the boom arm and use the base as a normal vertical microphone stand? Does the vertical part end in a standard 5/8"" thread?","yes, just tried my blue yeti on the vertical and it fits. Same threading as boom arm. :)-JonOfAllGames"
618,is it ATA compatible ? flying a amp head to europe in checked baggage,"I think it's ATA approved, not as a carry on, but in checked baggage, sure, it's a good case."
619,Will this metronome play 6/4 time tripletized in 18/8 time?,You can set it in 6/4 and then turn the triplet subdivisions on by using the triplet slider at the bottom. Or just set it to a consistent click and do the counting yourself :)
620,Is this a good fit for an 88 key Williams Allegro keyboard? Width is 45 inches and the weight is 38 pounds.,"I am not quite sure but I suppose it should be okay. I got it for my 88 key Yamaha P-105 (Width 52 3/16"" and weight 25.8 lbs) and it worked very well :)"
621,"I have a Rogue LX-200B, would it fit in this case?",I use this for a Fender fretless and it fits perfectly. Not sure about your axe though!
622,"Can this be used with amateur (ham) radios, and how is the mic activated? I have a foot switch so it cannot be a pust to talk.","Yes you can.  The headset comes with a battery box that holds 2 ""AAA"" batteries that power the mic.  One end of this box has a 1/8"" phono plug where you connect the headset cord, and the other end has a short wire with a 1/8"" phono jack.  I cut off this 1/8"" jack and wired it to an 8 pin connector for my Kenwood TS-590 radio.  I also wired in am 1/4"" phono plug to accept either a hand switch or foot switch for PTT."
623,What are the internal dimensions of this item?,36x16x6 but my keyboard (actually little larger) still fits great.  0 measures 37.75x14.25x5 and it fits great.  I love the quality of it.
624,"I'm buying for someone who has a Fender acoustic guitar (DG-8S). Size she gave me: 40"" x 16"".  Will this case fit it?  Thanks.","Yes. The height is 44"" and the body at 16"" at the widest (bottom) will be a perfect fit. The height at 3 3/4"" per spec is also okay."
625,what is the seat width ?,"Just measured: it's 10"" in diameter. The lowest seat height is 14"" (13.5"" with the bolt removed)"
626,"Good morning, I wonder if the price is per pair or a single horn?",the price is only one
627,"hi,I was wondering if I can control the sound/music selection from a distance (wirelessly/Bluetooth)? It doesn't mention that.Thanks",No Bluetooth capability.
628,How long are the screws?,"The total length of these screws is one inch.   Excluding the head, the length is 7/8 of an inch."
629,Can I switch between keys for tuning a diatonic instrument?,"It does NOT set to a certain key to tune as it just allows to tune ALL the notes in turn.  You play a note, it detects what note you are trying to play and displays it along with the needle pointing straight up if you are right on or left/right if you are low/high.  As you change the tone of the instrument in tuning, the needle moves so that you can get it in tune as straight up.  Thus, you tune a plethora of notes as shown on a normal piano keyboard, bottom to top.  You can tune A,B,C,D,E,F,G and the sharps and flats of all the notes.  I've tuned pianos, violin, and guitar with it.  It also will emit a sound (that you set).  That way you can tune by ear to the sound.

Show Less","The difference in tension betwen normal and hard is about 1 pound difference per string. It's like the difference between .010 and .011 on steel string, though the tension will be less I believe than either of those."
631,I want to put it under the hood of a car to create the illusion of a smoking engine... is this a hazard?,"I tried to put it under my Halloween costume to make it look like ghost fog, it doesn't produce enough fog to come out of the costume."
632,Is this a ground level fog or the usual fog?,It is an airbourne fog. It is famous having the worlds longest hangtime. CryoFreeze is Froggy's Ground Fog.
633,I was just told by a saxophone professor that all new sax's leak & will need to be adjusted. Will I need to get it adjusted after I receive the horn?,"Hey Alex,I lit a flashlight through the bell of the two L J Hutchen Alto Saxophones I purchased (in a dark room) and did not see any leaks.  I would also recommend a Snark metronome for tuning before playing."
634,"REceived my Light, plugged it in yesterday. Motor is running. No lights. Don't know how to contact you except here. Please help.","Though I do love what these lights do for a party. The bulbs go out on these really quick. I suspect because they are 300watts each, which is pretty hot! The replacement bulbs are about $6.00."
635,I want to podcast from local pubs in town. Would this kit be decent for a couple of guys sitting around a pub style table and talking about beer?,Fairly good pick up with this Mic and depending on the software and how well you adjust the input it should do a great job for you. I have been using this mic for a year now for podcasting and have been able to narrow the pick up range to cut out the majority of ambient noise..
636,Is this microphone compatible with my Nikon D5100?,"As long as it accepts the 1/16 mic plug, it shouldn't be a problem. You might check for other reviews, you may need to adjust down the camera's mic level if the sound is coming out too hot."
637,Do all the functions on this pedal work without the hot hand attachment?  Do you HAVE to use the hot hand sensor?,"Hello YES, the Hot Hand adds some additional controls to the pedal, Thanks from 8thstreet Music"
638,Does the mic have a case?,no
639,What is the size of the drum?,12 inch head x 24 inch in height
640,does this have wheels?,No. But I bungee cord it to a folding luggage cart and wheel it around just fine.
641,Would you recommend this for live use? Is it sturdy yet light/easy to transport/set-up?,"Yes, it is both solid, and simple, and folds to a smaller size. It isn't light, but, you can't have everything.  It is much more solid than most x-brace stands."
642,Does this metronome have a different sound to the downbeats? I see there are 2 possible sounds.,"There are two sounds possible, but you only get one or the other- so if you are asking if you can change the sound so beat one has a different sound from the other beats in a measure, no- it doesn't do that. Of the two sounds, one is rather ""woody"" like an old school metronome, the other is more like a ""beep"" but not as annoying as lots of cheap metronomes. It has a volume control too- nice touch."
643,Has anyone had the same problem as I with this pickup? I bought this pickup brand new from David Gage himself. The pickup lasted for exactly 11 gigs.,"I would first check for a pinched or crimped wire especially near the output and the sensor. If that doesn't reveal any answers and the unit just simply died, then contact David and he will take care of you. The last thing a manufacturer wants is an unhappy customer."
644,the Clip-on microphone does NOT pickup sounds. It works if one holds in front  of mouth. Any suggestion?,"this product has VERY Poor ""Gain"" input ! and the transmitting Pack cannot be adjusted. I regret even purchasing this product."
645,My stylus says OMP 20 on it --- will this one work?,If your stylus looks like this it does not matter the model they are all interchangeable.  I use the pro S concord as I find they has the best bang for the buck
646,One of the reviews says that  this unit can adjust the pitch. Is this true?,"Aloha From Hawaii!  Yes, you are able to adjust the pitch from this unit.  If you get this unit, you'll be happy!  I know I was pleasantly surprised when I hooked it up!  Enjoy!"
647,"PLEASE, How do you TURN OFF THE BASS LINES? Im trying to record and have my own bass lines I want to add.","Press the ""Bass Mute"" button below the LCD display."
648,"Recording King ROS-627 - a 000-style guitar. Do you think this saddle would be a good addition to it? Currently has uncompensated, bone bridge.",I think it would be a good replacement saddle for that guitar.  Intonation should be improved.
649,Can I place a Multi-Plug 5 cable at the end of the 8 plug cable?,Check the mA power consumption of each of your pedals.  The One Spot can provide 1700mA.  If the total power consumption of all your pedals is below 1700mA then you can string as many together as you'd like.
650,is it made in China?,Yes
651,can you connect a laptop to this amplifier?  and if so how?,"You need a cable with a 3.5mm stereo male plug at one end and two RCA male plugs at the other.  The 3.5mm plug goes into the laptop's headphone jack.  The RCA plugs will plug directly into the amplifier.  Amazon sells this cable.  By the way, the Yamaha is a great amp."
652,"Are the keys weights, does it feel like an acoustic piano?","Not really. But I've been playing mine for several years now and the feel of the keys is really okay. It isn't enough of a difference to be a bother. However, the harder you hit a key, the louder it plays. That's a nice feature."
653,Can this be hooked up to output to my home theater system?,"Sure you could do that but unless your home system consists of pro audio gear (loudspeakers or powered loudspeakers, amplifiers with balanced xlr connections etc) and you need to mix vocal mics and/or instruments, it might be overkill (as you will not be using many of the functions available). For instance if your audio system uses RCA connectors, the mixer does have RCA inputs/outputs, so you could easily do it, I am just not sure if it would be worth it. If you post a picture of your gear or give a more detailed list of expectations I can give a better answer."
654,"I need to know, is the output for the headphones 1/4 inch only or does it have a 1/8 output as well?",There is only one output. A 3.5mm socket. The input is 1/4 inch.
655,does this lap steel need amplipher and speaker,"Definitely, unless you like quiet solitude."
656,Does the device have a storage area for sheet music?,No it does not.
657,can you put it on a table,"Sure but the height cannot be adjusted on a table unless you use books or bricks, etc."
658,Will a Gibson ES-135 fit in this case?,I fit a Gibson ES-137 inside no problem. It should be fine with an ES-135. Although I believe SKB make a case for the 135.
659,The picture of the Uke and theProduct Description do not show or say anything about this being an electric Uke?.,You can tell the difference by the models a KA-T has no pickup the KA-TE is electric. If this is your first uku i would by the KA-T then if you like it upgrade later
660,"Can you please provide interior dimensions, including overall interior length and upper and lower bout measurements.  Thanks!","I love this case.....great fit for my Oscar Schmidt uke.......internal length is 25 inches/ larger bell width is 8 3/4 inches interior measurement, and smaller bell is 6"" even. The case has a small compartment under neck area as well as a Velcro strap to hold uke in place. Hope this is helpful!"
661,"What is it made of, and where was it made?","It's ceramic, and I believe it was made in the US. I'm not too sure. But it's beautiful and well worth the money. If you're in the market for an Ocarina get this one. I play mine every day, and it's super easy to learn."
662,The Product Features section notes that this tube is good for guitar amps. Does that make it less than ideal for a phono preamp?,"I thought it sounded great in my phono pre. Very clear, well defined, excellent bass."
663,i have a 12 cords guitar which better narrow or wide format,"The important thing to consider is the thickness of your saddle.  If your saddle is 3/32"" (2.4 mm) thick, you need the narrow pick-up.  If your saddle is 1/8"" (3.2 mm) thick, you need the wide saddle"
664,Is there other equip. that's needed/useful to buy with this to set up a nice vocal recording area?,You could buy an external mixer but it is not really necessary. You can also purchase sound mixing/editing software such as Sony Forge or Sony ACID. Go to www.sonycreativesoftware.com for more details on this.
665,how is the sound being plugged vs not being plugged to an amp?,"When it's plugged, you can make it an amplified acoustic sound or the electric sound. Not plugged, it sounds like a beginner guitar, which is fine!"
666,"Can these be used for both the vocals and the music, or do you need separate speakers for the music?",You don't need anything but these speakers.  They do both.  They sounds great too
667,What is the height of this unit?,It is 27 1/2 inches height
668,Planning on getting a Blue Yeti Shock Mount and was wondering if this was going to be able to support the weight?,"Definitely. I have the shock mount, blue yeti pro and the windscreen all mounted on the PSA1.  You will have no problems."
669,What is the height of the instrument with the stand? I am trying to find a good location for it in my house. Thank you.,"Approx 36"" perhaps 38."
670,"Is setting up that tripod part difficult? How ""stretched out do u put the tripod",It goes up pretty easy if you play out it needs to be all the extended but in my studio I keep it in a bit because of space and have had no problems JK
671,"Will a 38"" cutaway style acoustic guitar fit in this case?","measure your guitar. My acoustic is 41"" long, 11.5"" across near the cutaway and 15.5"" across at it's widest and about 4.75"" deep and the guitar fits the case fairly snug with a little bit of room to spare all around. I'd almost say it's just about a perfect fit for me and I absolutely love it (and paid twenty less than what it's going for now in April 2012). Keep in mind, the case will smell for a couple weeks while the lacquer or whatever it is they use finally dissipates and dries out; but after that, it is a very nice case for the money (at least it used to be when it was twenty less).

672,Does this piano have weighted keys?,Not really.  They have some feel but are not like playing a piano.  You can find keyboards that have that feature.
673,"I have an older Alesis midi keyboard controller, the QX49.  Will this be ok for starters? and do you think it will work with Omnisphere?","Should work, it's just a Midi controller."
674,What are the advantages of getting this QI version (with hookup); why at some point in the future would I want a hookup?,I like it for the built in tuner and the ability to use it with an amp.
675,Can the drum fit on a taller stand?,According to one of our local music stores the answer would be yes.  I bought it for my 11 year old nephew who just entered the fifth grade and stands almost 6'... we will be looking for a taller stand next school year.
676,I am very musically challenged.  Why would you buy a tenor over a soprano uke?  Is it that one has deeper richer tones?,"I have both. The soprano is easier to chord but I have large fingers so I like the tenor because there's more room between strings and frets. You're right though, the tenor does sound richer."
677,"I bought my son's guitar used, it has reverse headstock (opposite of standard Dinky).  Is there room for this in the case, or is that section molded ?",It'll fit fine. The space for the headstock is open and not molded.
678,Before I purchase. what do I need to know what hard ware and soft ware will put my system in use?,"The USB EWI is a midi controller and connects to the couputer through a USB cable, so you need a USB port.  It also draws its power thru the USB port. It comes with Garritan software that generates the sounds for the different instruments.  Has LOTS of sounds and they are excellent!   It helps to have a good quality sound card, but is not necessary.  You can upgrade your computer sounds and speakers later if you want.  Most modern computers have plenty of processing speed.  The software runs under Windows so you need that.  I run mine on a desktop computer with a SoundBlaster card and speakers.  I also run it on a laptop with a Soundblaster plug in. The instrument sounds range from very good to excellent.  My favorites sounds are the clarinets, flutes, and violins.  The brass instruments are quite good as well.There are some good online sites to get help. ewiusb dot com is very good and you can google ""Bernie Kenerson"" for lessons.  He will give live lessons via Skype and is an outstanding EWI musician.I had Bells' Palsy for two years and was unable to play my clarinet and saxophones because half of my face was paralyzed.  I COULD play my EWI though and used it in my church orchestra.  I ran it with my laptop and plugged the sound into the sound system and no one could tell the difference between my EWI and my clarinet.  There are also additional sound libraries you can get later to expand your number of available instruments.

679,What are the dimensions of the seat?,"Dimensions of seat: 23 3/4"" wide, 13 1/8"" deep. Height adj:21 1/4"" to 27"" . Amazon and others list the maximum height as being 25 3/4; probably as a precaution.  I am 6'3"" tall and will adjust to maximum height because I like to stand from time to time.Use caution at that height because of instability. Not the most comfortable seat but to find a folding stool at 27"" at that price is worth it. Good luck!!!!!"
680,"Hi, does this work for a Martin Backpacker? Thanks","I am not sure.  I think backpackers are pretty narrow if I recall.  I think Gator provides interior measurements somewhere...  you'd just have to check.  Good news if it doesn't fit, send it back!"
681,"Forgive me if this has already been mentioned, but does this unit have EQ? and if so what kind and how customizable is it?","Every amp preset has the same tone control complement you would find on the actual amp, and when connected to a computer, you can access the parametric EQ for each preset. This EQ works separately from the amp tone controls.You access the amp's tone controls by opening the preset on the unit directly or in the computer software interface. I'd advise going to DigiTech's website and download the manual. It will tell you everything you need to know. The available control parameters are very broad!"
682,Is it possible to record all 4 channels and end up with 4 separate files?,"It can be done, but not directly.  The H4N will allow you to record four channels at once, which are saved as two stereo files.  If you have audio software, you can then divide those stereo files into individual mono files.  It's a little cumbersome, but it can be done."
683,DOES IT NEED PHANTOM POWER ?,Not quite sure what phantom power means but it only requires a USB plugin. I've used mine every day for Skype and quite often for voice acting. Perfect for the cost.
684,can you plug it to an amp?,"Not this model, but they do make an acoustic/electric version of this guitar"
685,It is suitable for voice talent? Give a clear voice?,I use it with the recording software works fine
686,"When this stand is completely folded and packed by itself (not included the box or any packing materials),,,, How big it is¿¿¿ ( L x W x H).  Thanks","31""x11""x8"" here you go!"
687,"Is it ok to daisy chain a passive 15"" speaker to a 12""speaker (8 ohms) for mains, I realize the split in ohms when doing this but is it kosher??","Yes, that is OK. Just make sure to not over power them. Remember, the total power in will be divided in HALF, going to each speaker, so even if the 15"" speaker can handle more, the total max power output of your amp shouldn't exceed twice the rating of the 12"" speaker."
688,Can I connect 5 of these to get 10 independent audio output channels generated by the computer via usb?,"In theory you can, i have 2 usb cards connected to my laptop, plus the internal one, and all of them work, so in theory it should work. The only problem i see, is how the computer would identify each one of the usb audio interfaces, and how the user (you) would know each interface.Another thing that can help is to use the ASIO4ALL audio driver, if you are using Windows.Hope this helps."
689,Will this case be a good fit for a Gibson 339?  Does anyone know or have one they have put in this case?,"I cannot answer that for sure; however, this case works great for Strat and Tele style guitars. If I had to guess, I would say no to the Gibson 339 even though it is smaller than a 335 which would definately NOT fit."
690,Are the dimensions listed correctly for a tenor uke;  shouldn't it be like  26 to 27 inches long.  & wider?    also is the 0u2P suppose to be ou2 T.  Thanks,Dimitri and David W. have given you good dimension info.The image shown does not match the description of this uke.  I actually ran in to this problem when I ordered one as a gift for my husband recently.  I ordered from the image and was expecting an OU2T and received and OU2P that I had to exchange.  The OU2P is the pineapple shape.  The OU2T is the tenor body with a waist.  You can see the difference between the shapes here: http://www.oscarschmidt.com/products/ukes/  I pointed out the error to Amazon and they have apparently not fixed it.  :/

692,"What is the difference between all the frequencies? N1 to N4? I just need to use as a fitness instructor. Also, Does this system hook up to speakers?","There are actually five frequencies, a seperate one for each microphone in the same venue.  If you are only using one microphone, it doesn't matter which one you use.  This will hook up to a powered speaker, but will need an amplifier for an unpowered speaker."
693,can you directly plug in an ipod to it with the right aux cord,"I run my Android phone to it from the phone's headphone jack. However, as I learned after purchasing the speaker, you cannot run the full (stereo) signal back to the Behringer. This PA is strictly mono, so the cable I use is like this: SF Cable, 12 feet 3.5mm Stereo Male to Two RCA Male Splitter Cable You will have to also purchase an adapter like this: Hosa Cable GPR101 RCA To 1/4 Inch TS Adaptor - 2 Pack There are two there, but since your Behringer only has one input, you'll plug one of the two RCA ends of your cord into the 1/4"" adapter, and the adapter into the Behringer. You won't be getting a stereo signal, but with most music, you won't notice it unless you're an audiophile.

694,Has anyone ever plugged this into a TASCAM to record the sound there?,"No. But I have recorded with numerous other digital recording devices with no problem. Th emit comes with adapter XLR and 1/8"" adapter cables."
695,What type of battery does it use?,Triple A (AAA)
696,"can this be run into my mixer for recording? if so does it cut the speaker sound, cause I want it to do that for home recording purposes.","Anyone try running the output through the Fx Loop Send, increasing gain and lowering the Volume(so the speaker isn't heard)?But if this works you'll loose the Power tube phase. I'm using Blackstar Ht Metal's Emulated Output for this purpose."
697,Does this unit have dual power source (110/220 Volts? Thanks.  NANA,"My Gemini Model CDMP6000 CD/MP3/USB Player has a three pronged power inlet jack on the back of unit which is labeled ""Power Supply AC 110/240V, 60/50 Hz, consumption 25 watts. Only one power cable, with a label on it stating 10A 125V came with the unit that plugs in a standard three prong (3rd is ground) 110/120volt outlet. Based on the label on the unit back, it does appear that the player  will accept 110/240V. Always best to confirm with manufacturer and I am not certain if the supplied detachable power cord fits 220-240Volt supply jacks because I am not familiar with those. The power cable that came with this Gemini CD is labeled 10A 125V so it may not be a 220 volt cable. The player may operate at higher voltage, but may need to obtain a cable for such, unless Gemini supplies it. Sounds like best idea is to confirm with manufacturer/distributor. Maybe they offer units with higher voltage power supply cable. Not syre if the 110-125V supplied cable is applicable to 220/240 volt supplies. Hope this helps.

701,"anyone own the Wavedrum? i remember the first round of these in 90s, but those were really expensive.  can anyone tell me anything about this drum?","I just picked one up today, it's amazing. I don't know how it compares to the original, but I'm pretty happy with it. I switched from playing ethnic drums (congas and djembe) to electronic drums (zendrum) a few years ago. I really love the zendrum but I've missed the simplicity of playing a single surface like the djembe. The Wavedrum feels about like a djembe with a synthetic head that's not terribly tight. It's very comfortable to play with your hands and you can set it up for sticks. The sounds are are mixture of samples and synthetics that are modulated by the input from the drum head, so the drum feels very live and acoustic (I had a Roland Handsonic, the Wavedrum feels much more real and responsive). The sounds range from fairly realistic acoustic sounding drums to completely synthed out analog sounds. It is not a midi instrument, in any sense, if you're looking for a controller but it's a very cool instrument in it's own right. The only downside I can see it the parameter editing is done through a completely minimal 5 button, 2 knob interface but I suspect they're trying to hit a low price point. If it's successful, maybe they can put in a USB connection and make some editing software.

702,Is the headphone jack for a 1/4 inch (large) or a 1/8 inch (small) headphone plug?,It has a small headphone plug. It is the same size jack that might be used on a portable radio or MP3 player.
703,Do you need to use something sharp to break the surface before using it for the first time?,"No you don't.  Using a sharp object on rosin will cause it to break into pieces and shorten its lifespan.  What you do is simply apply the rosin to your bow hair.  I find a few full bow strokes over the surface of the rosin is all that is necessary.  This particular rosin is Jade green, and over time your bow hair will turn green.  Use a washcloth to remove excess rosin from your strings where the bow comes in contact with them.  Pinch each string gently with the washcloth between your fingers, and gently clean your strings one at a time.  A washcloth can also be used to remove fingerprints from the body of your cello.

Note however, that this item is not waterproof, therefore it must be protected from the elements."
705,"Which is the better buy for the price difference:  Yamaha C40, Cordoba CP 110 or Cordoba C3M","Like some of the fellow reviewers below, I am a novice classical guitar player.  I have been playing steel string acoustic and electric for a couple of years but want to develop my guitar playing further by trying classical style.  I did try the yamaha at a local guitar store in my area.  I agree with bpickin that you cannot go wrong with a yamaha.  In fact, my primary acoustic guitar is a mid-priced yamaha (actually acoustic/electric) and I love it.  As best I could play some notes and chords on the yamaha C40 at the store, I liked its sound and thought that the overall tone was pretty balanced (neither the high or low end was louder than the other).  That said, I bought the Cordoba C3M anyway.  Why?  First, after reading reviews (for what they are worth) and talking with friends who play steel string electric, I decided the cedar top was the preference among those that actually know more than I do.  I also researched and found some articles on the different types of wood and decide the mahogony for the sides and back were preferred too.  And given Cordoba's reputation and focus on classical guitars, I felt that it would be a good choice (I actually put together a spreadsheet with the different guitar parameters important to me to help guide the choice).  I had the money to buy the C5 but just wasnt sure about my ability to master classical style so opted not to invest quite so much in a guitar.  I cannot comment on the CP110 as I didnt really give it a good look (But the reviewer below makes a good point that the ""pak"" gives you a lot of needed accessories if you dont have them already).  Looking at current prices on Amazon for the C40 and C3M you are talking about a $75 price difference.  If that's meaningful for your budget right now, consider how serious you are about playing - if you're going to work on classical style (it's tough) then maybe the cordoba is a good choice.  If you're not sure - go with the Yamaha.  Since I owned a Yamaha, I wanted to also own ""something else"" (I know that's silly).  But $75 can buy a nice case or stand for the Yamaha.  Either way, you cannot go wrong.  As for actually ownership, I did have a significant shipping issue that Amazon resolved as only Amazon does - quickly and with total satisfaction.  The C3M came and the bottom of the guitar was significantly cracked.  When I got the replacement, it worked well right out of the box.  No real buzzing strings and stays in tune pretty good so I'm pretty pleased with it.  Hope this helps and enjoy whichever one you get.

706,does this have any Lithium ion battery in it?? Please reply as early as you can..!!,No batteries in it at all. Works off you blowing into it while pressing down keys
707,Can  this be used with a karaoke machine?,"Without seeing the karaoke machine it would be difficult to answer. It has one XLR input and a 1/4"" RCA to the PA., which is how we use it. I would certainly think it would work, depending on the karaoke machine's capabilities."
708,Is this HPAEC840 ear cushion as soft as BOSE QC15 ear pad ? Or the AE2 series?,"I'm not familiar with those pads, but these are stupid soft with a nice fuzzy texture to make your ears feel like they are enclosed by thier own private sound pillows."
709,are theses active speakers and are they great quality?,Yes they are active. They're SUPER quality!!
710,What age group do you think it is?,3 to 10 years
711,what footswitch goes with the kg212fx,do not know   don't have it now
712,"Does the USB connection output to seperate tracks, or is it all mixed together into one track?",It's all one track. It's the main channel output that gets put out the USB cable.
713,Is there a timer function on this remote?,No timer.  Just a button that must be manually depressed to emit fog.
714,does it come with to sticks?,"Hi James. This drum is supplied with only one stick. At 8 inches in diameter, it would be a bit small to accommodate two. On the plus side, this hand held drum sounds wonderful when struck with the fingertips, and I have used both hands doing that (alternating), so I suppose one could use two sticks if desired. This (for me) was a good deal (reasonably priced and of high quality). I hope this helps!"
715,"What are the interior dimensions? - total length; body length; upper, middle, and lower bout; and thickness","Total Length - 41""  body length 19 1/2""  width at lower bout 13 1/2""...upper bout 10 1/2""  I would check the dimensions of the Pro Jet at the Gretsch site to be sure if you are buying this case for anything other than a Pro or Duo Jet.  Gretsch will recommend the appropriate case."
716,Does it have weighted keys?,Yes the keys are weighted to feel like a real piano
717,will  it  work on windows 8,"Yes, it will."
718,how long is the cord????,"52"""
719,will this light work off an rv generator or Ac and Dc ?,"These are SMD LEDs, which are designed for 12.0V-DC.  The will, however operate on as little as 9V, up to a maximum of 18V before damaging them.  They are DC ONLY!  Running on AC current will damage them permanently.  Also, 16.4' utilizes roughly 24W of power, and requires 2A output minimum on the power supply.  If you are running these from the RV battery bank or the alternator, you will have more than ample power to supply several of these strips nightly.  I am running six strips of these lights, one of them 24x7 from a bank of two 100Ah deep-cycle batteries, and the draw per day is only 12% of my total off-charge capacity daily.  One strip can be ran for 4-days or more, without recharge!  In an average RV setting, 4-6 hours per night, two batteries will supply the several strips for a week without need for recharge.

If it is a CDG and the words still don't show, I would check on the internet and contact the maker for an instruction book to download.  Good luck!"
721,People seem to be reporting that this thing is 400mA on the shared 9v/12v port. The image shows 300mA.  Can you clarify which it actually is?,"Mine has ""400mA"" printed on it, like this photohttp://www.voodoolab.com/images/p_ppiso5_lg.jpg"

724,What is the thickness of the wedge foam used?,"It's 2"" pymaramid Auralex Acoustics studio foam"
725,Do I just plug it into an outlet? Or what wire does it have?,It plugs into a normal three prong outlet.
726,"How big is this guitar? I'm a small person, so looking for something not too big!",This one is too big. It was much bigger than the description made it out to be. It would be for a large person in my opinion.
727,Do you need to buy a separate amp to use this set?,You don't need an amp per say. But you will need speakers/studio monitors or anything you can use as a speaker. I am using an amp as a speaker b/c I already had an amp I wasn't using. There are no external speakers so without a speaker you will only be able to hear the kit through headphones.
728,Is the Onyx Blackjack working flawlessly with OS X 10.10 Yosemite,Like a champ. No changes in performance since upgrade.
729,will these be OK to use with my garage band to be used hooked to a voice mixer amp?,The quality of sounds sucks. They sound muzzled.
730,What is the weight of this case?,"Don't know the exact weight, but it is very light."
731,I want to use this with a laptop to teach exercise online using a MAC. Will this product work for this?,"As a microphone, yes - but you will need to get it connected to your computer somehow.  The included adapters are for connecting through a wireless body pack  and receiver pair, not for direct connection to a computer."
732,Can I bypass both the built-in mic and the preamp to use it as an A/D converter only?,"I'm not sure what you mean.  If you plug this into a Mac, and set it up as your output audio device, all your stereo outputs will be processed by the One instead of the internal sound card.  If you're asking can you use the One like a ""line in"", then the answer is no.  Well, at least not in stereo.  It does line-level monaural, though.  So you could plug a keyboard into it, or the left OR right of a stereo out of a keyboard, and you would have all the legendary A/D conversion you crave one side at a time.  This is why I sold my ONE and got the old-school Duet Firewire.  Definitely worth getting the Duet if you produce lots of stereo stuff, and it make A/D conversion a breeze with anything you can plug into it at line level.

Please tell me how to set this instrument up for triggering MIDI samples.,"First off, I'm assuming that you are connecting an external module or sampler...on the Alesis Perc pad, you need to connect the midi plug into the midi in and out from the sampler. You then have to set the midi channel on the Alesis and also for which pad you want your sampling to come out on by hitting it. let me know if you need more explanation. Thanks"

745,Does this case hold a FULL size adult violin?,"Yes, my violin is full size :) it holds all the accessories too!"
746,"I have an acoustic Takemine S35 measuring 41"" x 15.5"" x 4.5"" deep, so do you have something in this price range to fit my guitar?","That sounds like the standard size of a dreadnought, and I just took a tape measure to my Rogue and those are the same measurements. This hard case fits mine like a glove. So I don't see why it wouldn't fit yours."
747,when powering on flashing blue lights appear and cannot be stopped. whats going on?,"Not sure but I had to send mine out to California to be fixed because the CD drawers was cycling and wouldn't stop. The guy just sent me a new one finally.It took some searching on line to find the repair placeTry unplugging from the wall, then depressing the power button for 30 seconds and try again"
748,Is this controler compatable with virtual DJ pro,Any numark controller is compatable with any virtual DJ system. You just need to go into the settings and configure it correctly
749,I am a worship leader and upcoming artist. I would like to invest in this product but my question is will I need a transmitter along with this purchase?,"I have this unit, and I love it!  I purchased this pack without the main transmitter box, but In my situation, I play drums and the singer has the same unit, but he has the full system with the main box. I feed off his signal on stage, so I don't need my own main box - the main transmitter box can feed multiple units--  but in some cases, since mine is not ""wireless"" when it's on it's own, I would run a cable to the headphone feed on the snake or wherever, and then I would have my own headphone mix...  but basically, If it's just you using the system, you will need the entire get up to go wireless, including the main transmitter box... confused? (ha) ...!

750,How big is the package shipped? Is it only one package or many? Thanks,"It comes in two boxes. One is about 24x24x24, the other is about 24x12x16."
751,Are there any build-in speakers with this keyboard?,"No, it does not have build-in speakers"
752,I am in need of a cheap boom pole for the occasional freelance shoot. Will this one work with ANY mic and shockmount? I have an Azden SGM-2X.,"To quote one of the other reviews: 'The pole comes with a 3/8"" thread for the mic attachment, so you either need mike holder or a mount head that fits 3/8"" ', so you will have to figure out if that is the kind of mount you could get to your Azden mic."
753,Will a Yamaha F-335 fit into this case?,no it won't I had to return mine as the size stated on the website is not the correct size.  It is actually smaller than what is listed.  Hope this helps
754,does it also play a cd?,"No, it doesn't. It would be much better if it did."
755,Will this fit a Tak EC132-c?,"Yes, that is what I bought it for."
756,Is this case lockable?  Thank you.,"Does not have a lock of its own on the case, you would have to provide its personal lock :)"
757,How long is this case?,"40"""
758,Can anyone confirm whether or not the keys on this keyboard are full-sized?,They are full size keys.
759,is there a dimmer on the remote,"Yes, there's a ""Bright"" button and a ""Dim"" button at the top of the control."
760,Will the cable perform the same way if I am using it with Virtual DJ on my laptop?,"Hi Kevin, to answer your question - Yes it performs great, you get to use your headphones and play other music in your HP while a track is playing in the speakers. I currently use it and it works like a champ."
761,"Why did you pick Zildjian A's over K's? I play mostly rock (bands like Chevelle, Tool, Breaking Benjamin)","I'm not a drummer, I host a jam session, and provide a drum set for sit-ins. One of my drummer buddies is a Zildjian endorser. He suggested the A's, saying they're less likely to break, and they're a little cheaper than the K set."
762,I am beginning to learn the violin and just bought this one. I was wondering how to properly attach the shoulder rest that came with it.,The shoulder rest goes on the back of the violin. The sides of the shoulder rest should pull straight out. Then tighten them back to fit the violin. Hope this helps
763,What is the difference between this foot pedal and the Infinity IN-USB-2 foot pedal?,I have this foot pedal....it must be a USB-3.....fast forward....play....rewind.....I'm not sure what a USB-2 is.  It works excellent.  I would rate this highly.
764,Is there an adjustable truss rod & tool?,"There more for structure than for adjustment. Not a great way to adjust the string height, change it at the nut or bridge for this guitar."
765,does this have an audio port?,It has a small microphone port and a potentiometer for adjustment.  The setup work extremely well.  I have installed two of these and they work flawlessly.
766,"made in USA,Mexico or Asia?",Mexico
767,"Does this include an AC Adaptor?  The product description says it does, but the 'Frequently Bought Together' section recomends a separate purchase","Yes, this include an AC Adaptor and the headphones"
768,Does this one come with the amp?,No. You'll have to buy an amp separate.
769,Is this a good buy for a 5th grader (beginner) ?????,Yes its perfect for a 5th grade.  I brought it for my son who is in 5th grade.
770,does this work with smart music software,"I'm not sure what smart music is, but plain and simple; It's a microphone.  I don't understand what issues people have with it.  I have used it with the iPhone 4s (with appropriate jack splitter), iPhone 5C (with appropriate jack splitter), computers with 3.5mm mic jack, Tascam DR-05, Tascam DR-40, maybe even somewhere else I can't remember.  It's just a microphone and sounds pretty good especially for the price."
771,"Have anyone used this amp in a home/house theater set-up environmnet, and is its' fan too loud when it's on? I have an open book shelf type furniture.",The fans in this amp are very quiet.I am using this amp as a pa setup but will also work as a home theater amp also. Keep in mind that you will need at least 3 amp to get to at least 5.1 with a sound processor or running each channel from a 5.1 or above DVD or blu-ray player with each channel running separate into each channel of the amp. So 3 amps equal 6 channels in total. Front right-front left amp 1.  Right side- left side amp 2. Center- sub with built in cross over amp 3.  I hope this answers your question.
772,is this work with window 7 computers?,"Yes. It uses USB port, so it should work just fine, provided you have compatible software."
773,can you record your voice,Yes. You can record your voice with the Magix Music Maker MX. You will need a decent microphone. There are several reasonably priced USB mics floating around.
774,can you do rim shots on this set?,"Yes, you can use the rim on the snare (it is a dual trigger pad) to trigger any sound including a ""rim shot"". This is an amazing little electronic drum kit. I have been playing drums for over 30 years and have owned other electric kits."
775,does it work for mac book pro computer,Not sure
776,Gave this to my 80 year old parents to use in car/RV but unit is squealing and I think it's caused by car's electronics.  How do we avoid this?,Either the mic is too close to amplifier or it's turned up to high.  Cannot go max volume.
777,Are the tripods included?  It wasn't listed in the description.,No they were not included.
778,Does this item also come with an iLok device required for PT11?,"Hi, Yes it does come with the Ilok."
779,What is the resistance of the keys like - is it anything similar to a real piano?  Thanks.,Not like a piano.  More resistant than a piano. But not too noticeable.
780,does it come with a sustain pedal- essential!,"Would be nice! But, no."
781,Could this be good to copy data Cd/dvds ?,I use the Dopystars DVD duplicator at our police department and copy dvd's from Walmart on shoplifting cases and accidents on the parking lot.  I've had plenty of success with the copier.  It normally takes 3-4 minutes to make a copy for prosecutors and defense attorneys.  Very pleased with this product!  I hope you find this helpful.
782,is this a full size guitar? is it nylon or steel string?,"Yeah, it is full-size. It is steel string. My suggestion would be to change the strings and put new ones on right away. It'll sound much better. Hope that helps :)"
783,Does this guitar have an adjustable truss rod?,"Yes, It does."
784,Does this item run only on 110v or does it accomdate 220-240v? Is it rechargable? Does ir run on batteries?,It runs on both 110 to 240v but the microphones are not rechargeable and it runs on simple batteries.
785,If I ran these from the L/R outputs on a mixing board into a single input on an interface would it give an accurate stereo image?,"It would give the sum of the two channels L and R into the interface port. The stereo image coming out of the mixer from the L and R port into the Y patch cable is stereo up till that point. When it passes through the Y cable, it becomes a summed signal or mono."
786,"This is a gift for my wife who works from home. I don't want her to know what she is getting , what does the box look like when recieved from UPS?","Hi John,Just give us a heads up when you place your order, and we can make sure to send it in an unmarked box, although there isn't much we can do about the size of the box. :-)We also ship to alternate addresses, such as places of work or neighbors/family/friends.Kind regards,Heather CaseKennedy Violins1.800.779.0242"
787,"There is one like this in the music store near me, and the owner told me that these ae only made in soprano size, not concert size.  Is that correct?",Mine is a concert.
788,Can I use this as is or do I need to have another piece of equipment for it to work?  Do I just start using with batteries?,U need something to hook it up to. Personally did not like it but u might.
789,is a pair of speaker o is one,Is just one
790,Does It work with A MacBook Air?,I mean it should I have the pro and it works
791,Last question.... Can I wire more than one LED strip light into this transformer (trying to avoid running them in series AKA end to end) that will be under 150v,"YES. This transformer can support LED strips in parallel or series as long as the sum of their Wattage is less than the 150W transformer rating.  For safety, my electrical engineer recommends staying below 90% of that 150W, or about 135W.  If running LED strips in series you will see some degradation in lighting due to the voltage drop if runs are too long.  I pieced together two strips in parallel from the transformer for my deck railing.  Each strip is spliced in sections, with wires soldered between sections to jump around railing posts.  One spliced strip runs about 40ft with negligible voltage drop, as evidenced by no discernible change in light levels from the first to the last LED.  Wire from the transformer to the beginning of each LED strip is 14guage outdoor landscaping wire.  I also have a Leviton magnetic low voltage dimmer switch upstream of the transformer.Hope this helps,Sam

792,can you listen to both cds at the sametime,No sorry I also tried it but it didn't work
793,does it play fm raido stations,"It does not.  In fact, it is not a very good product, way too much static"
794,what are the measurments and weight,"about 18"" by 6""weight is about a couple of pounds"
795,Does this work with the iphone?,Yes it does.
796,can you use with virtual dj?,I do not believe it is advanced enough to be able to map to Virtual DJ. The controller comes with MixVibes Cross LE DJ software.
797,Does it fit an IPAD AIR,"Ionic Rotating Stand Leather Case with SLEEP AND WAKE Functiontion - according to Apple's website, the iPAD Air is a different size than the previous iPADs.  See https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/   So I don't think that this case will fit the iPAD Air."
798,"Does this system come with two microphones as pictured and if so, are they wired or wireless?","I didn't get an answer through amazon, but through more research I found out it does include the mics and they are wired, not wireless."
799,What compny made this baritone?,"It is manufactured by Hawk.  The valves require constant maintenance oiling to prevent sticking, but it is not a big deal if you know that going in.  It is definitely a low-end instrument, but you really should know that just by the price tag.  The lower range is a bit rough sounding for me but frankly that could be the operator (me) or the mouthpiece, or both. With that understanding, it is a great instrument for a beginner, or someone who has a less demanding use of the instrument.  For me, it works great for my use in church services."
800,Does it come with the SDR-3 Installed?,"dear customer,no it is not installedhere is the link on page 23 you can see how to install SDR3, and it is very easyhttp://www.vocopro.com/products/pdf_manuals/jamcube.pdfThank youIvana"
801,"if you put heavier strings on ,are the any adjustments that would be required? I have no knowledge of set up procedures.","Heavier strings have a higher tension so they will pull on the neck harder thus raising the action. Once you put the heavier strings on, you will likely need to tighten (turn clockwise) the truss rod in the neck to counter the higher tension of the heavier strings. Look down the strings from the bridge like a gun barrel to see the slope in the neck (action)."
802,Would this add an octave up note to the guitar so it would sound like a 12 string and can it do it without adding fuzz?,"It will do an octave up, however you can't use the octave with out the fuzz on."
803,"Dimension You mentioned 42-16.5- 2. But an acoustic guitar height is bigger than 2, its around 5. Would you please provide exact dimension?",the -5D stands for 5 inches deep.
804,What's the longest distance that can be between transmitter and receiver before communication begins to fail?,"I have just used it on a large stage and it was fine.  Though I wish,  the battery lasted longer (fully charged).  Only lasted 1 1/2 hrs."
805,Is this case a good fit for a Fender Mando-strat?,"It is a tight fight for my cheap rogue mandolin, I dont know how well it would fit the fender electric one."
806,Boss is famous due to its quality! Is zoom good as boss? Does zoom provide any warranty? I think boss provides a 5 year warranty that one never uses!,I think zoom is pretty much bang for buck. Never had any issues. My zoom 505II still works!
807,What are the dimension of this case?,I'm going to say approximately 24 x 8 x 12. It's a pretty standard size.
808,is this guitar made in the USA?,Mexico
809,What key is this Saxophone in?,Tenor Sax is in Bb.  (The smaller Alto Sax is in Eb)
810,"I am wodering, has anyone used this on an acoustic cello? i wonder if this will pickup the lower sounds","Oh it picks up bass all right, just make sure you can control it because it will be loud!"
811,Does it provide 48V Phantom Power needed for Condenser microphones?,"Yes, from the spec: ""MIC - Each mono input channel offers a balanced microphone input via the XLR connector and also features switchable +48/+15 V phantom power supply for condenser microphones""."
812,Does this item have bluetooth,"No,buy a transmitter"
813,So I am a newbie to keyboards... is there an easy way to connect one of these Casio's to a home theater amplifier/receiver?,"Use the audio (mono) output on the 6000 to your aux audio input in your amplifier/receiver. Take care to balance keyboard audio with the amplifier audio, in other words, do not max out your audio output in either component. It's also good to make your connections with your keyboard audio at the lowest position, then increase your gain once the connections are made. This prevents any popping noise during the connection which could harm your speakers."
814,is there a way to plug in a pad for double bass pedal practice?,You can set the high hat pedal for a second bass drum.
815,I'm readng the comments and questions here and am a bit confused.  Is this the B-250 and 2 gals of flui,I purchased this item. They had the wrong item number associated with this item and I was sent an electrical breaker. BE CAREFUL ordering this item.
816,Would this device run off of a type of rechargeable battery? I would like to put one on my bicycle for riding at night.,"Used these lights on our haunted trail.  Before setting them in place and running power to a transformer we used a 12 volt, rechargeable battery used for jumping a car.  Worked fine for our purposes, yet very heavy.  Possibly a deer feeder/uninterruptible power supply battery or similar may do the job."
817,"is it a 41""?","Yes, it is.  It's a great guitar! And, it holds it's tuning much better than I would have thought.  It's a great kit.  Guitar case is really nice, too."
818,Is this a real leather case?,"as the previous reviewer said, it's not real leather.  it looks like a cross between canvas and leather.  it doesn't look bad."
819,Would the Maschine and/or the Mikro be useful for making Goth Rock and Industrial Music? All the tutorials I see are Hip-hop/Dub-step oriented...,Yes! Without question. I think the hip hop crowd is particularly attracted to it because it has the MPC look to it. That and it's really flexible. You could do anything you like with it. You may want to check out Damage from Heavyosity - I've used it with Maschine to make some really crazy industrial stuff.
820,include maschine 2.0 ??,"If you mean the operating software, yes."
821,Will this fit a Chinese Gibson Les Paul?,"I used mine on an Epiphone SG, which is made in China.It fit that fine, but, I can't say for sure it'll fit your Les Paul.Some of the reviews I've read say it'll fit.Hey, for ten bucks, roll the dice, dude.Ya know?"
822,Does this light support plant life?,I don't think it does but it look very beautiful in my aquarium. My fishes colors are enhanced by it and makes great mood lighting   well worth the price
823,is the red wire the neck or bridge pickup,"I am going to assume you have the pickups and are looking to install them. The red wire doesn't help me. Many pickups come with a red wire, they are different  on different makes, and sometimes even different on the same model, production run to production run. What will help you is the bezel or trim ring. These pickups come with trim rings. Turn the pickup sideways and compare the two. You will immediately notice that one trim ring is thicker than than the other.  You will also be able to tell the direction if you turn them sideways as there is an angle to the thickness as well, the thicker edge being installed toward the bridge. That thicker pickup is for the bridge position. The thicker ring being allowed because the strings are higher at the bridge than they are at the neck.

825,Hi! Are there any significant differences between the DP-32 and DP-24 except for number of tracks?,"No different.Thats why the prices are so close.The video tutorial is for both.Get the 32 though.Then you'll never feel cramped for tracks,and you can do less bouncing,that will keep the track more flexible as it develops."
826,What is the duration of the warranty from the manufacturer?  How well does this case hold up beyond the 1st six months?,"I've long since lost my info on the warranty. However, I've traveled to several countries with this case being chucked around with the luggage, mailed it internationally twice, and I've had it for about 2 1/2 years now. Still works perfect and the guitar has never been damaged inside."
827,"Does this item require batteries and, if so, how many & what size?",It does!  I will have to check I want to say 4 double A but I am not 100% sure.
828,This bundle does not show in the pictures it has the music tray nor the power plug. Are this included or not?,Yes both were included in the bundle!
829,Is this case cut to allow proper airflow into the X32?  The bottom doesn't looks like it; just looks flat & that design reportedly causes overheats.,"I've had this out on tour. Haven't had any issues with overheating. However all the venues I've been in are pretty well temperature controlled. Not sure if it would do well outdoors, but the console is pretty easily removed from the case if needed. You will have a hard time finding a quality case at this price, especially if you use digital snake like I do and don't need the doghouse."
830,Is this item sound active,Yes it is. It even has a sound sensitivity adjuster on it as well.
831,can you plug headphones to it and not hear the drums at all?,You'll hear the drums through the headphones. The speaker won't play anything. However if you're looking for a decent kit don't buy this item.  It can't keep up with multiple hits and depending on what you're playing it doesn't have double bass. It's almost a waste of money.
832,CAN IT WORK WITH WINDOWS 8.1?,Yes it can
833,Can you program this with Delphi?  Is there API documentation for a DLL that can me mapped into a programing language?,"I can't speak to Delphi compatibility but google ""DMX USB Pro Widget API Specification 1.44"" to find the Enttec API specification for the Enttec DMX USB Pro Widget which this device emulates (though not perfectly by any means).  In particular, most of what you need to know is discussed in the 'Application Message Format' and the 'Output Only Send DMX Packet Request'.  In essence, you'll simply send a sequence of bytes to the serial (i.e., COMx) port associated with the USB port into which you've plugged the device.  There's a block of header bytes, then your DMX values, followed by a trailer byte.  Once the device receives a block, it will repeat sending the DMX data until you send it a new block.  That's it.  Not really even an API, just some basic serial messages.  The device only supports the DMX controller functionality -- that is, it won't act as a DMX receiver (at least that's what the manufacturer says).  In Windows, in order to map a USB device to a virtual COM port, you'll want to download and install the FTDI drivers (http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm and it's best to use the Setup Executable noted in the Comments).

840,Anyone explain how to fit a Blue Snowball onto this ?,The boom has an adapter already threaded on the end. One Large ( standard) One small. Its on the end of the boom. I have $ 100.00 Snowball (silver) an it works with that. Just unscrew the stand off and thread the snowball on the boom
841,Are the EL84s a matched set? Do the 3 ECC83s include a balanced V3 position?,"Hello,The EL84 quad is matched. The ECC83s are not balanced. Thank you"
842,"I live in an apartment and have a noisy neighbor, mostly kitchen banging sounds and walking. Will this help dampen the sounds?","No.Basically, you're experiencing the sucky part of apartment living.This is for sound absorption, not soundproofing. Soundproofing is typically done by installing mineral wool or other soundproofing materials in the walls, floors, and ceilings during construction of a unit.  Acoustic foam only absorbs and displaces sound waves emanating in a room (e.g. they make an ""echoey"" room less ""echoey"").Sound Proofing = stopping of sound waves, as in moving from room to room like your noisy neighbor.Sound Absorption = absorbs extra sound waves in a particular space.Trust me, there is nothing you can buy on the internet that will fix your noisy neighbor problem. A better solution would be to ask said neighbor to observe more respectable noise levels appropriate for apartment living.

843,instructions?,There are no manual included from the manufacture.  Below are a couple instruction video links:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3E5CHze2lYhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoWWQvDsfsUhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCgrnqACavkhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Df3PsZM8shttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6bUJOnwcjEhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmloaqXtJlAPlease provide email address so that we can send you the wiring diagram picture.
844,Is this on-ear or over the ear?,This are over-the-ear ear cup headphones that cover the entire ear.
845,How long is the bar between pedals?,"its about 13inches,,,but is adjustable  to make it longer also."
846,Does it allow you to plug in headphones so only you can hear your playing?,"Yes_and it uses the higher quality pro 1/4"" headphone jack instead of the cheaper and buzzy 1/8""."
847,Can these speakers be connected to an Airport Express station? The Airport Express has a dual RCA type connector I believe.,If your airport has RCA it will work but the new airports don't have RCA maybe the older ones do. But you could get adapters to hook them up RCA to blutooth or optical audio to RCA.
848,"The description under product features states 6R, are they 6R or 3R and 3L?",They are 3R and 3L. hope this helps.
849,does it screw into spots just like normal light bulbs?,"Yes. That was the easy part.  However, it is a screw that secures the rotating plastic is what I was referring to in my review."
850,"Silly question but I have to make it...as you specifies this product com with pro tools express, so is supposed I can control the ezdrummer?","Actually, this is an error on Amazon. It does not come with Pro Tools Express, it comes with Ableton Live Lite, and Ignition software. If you wanted to use EZdrummer, you should not have any problems."
851,How is the Bluetooth? How much is its range?,"I got upto 25 feet, but hard to connect sometimes"
852,what is the difference in H K M model ?,The models themselves are the same. The difference in lettering is based on the frequency programmed. See Shure's website to verify the best unit for you based on your geographic location and the primary location.
853,Will this amp make me a Rock God so chicks will dig me?,It has plenty features even more when you use the software.   It is loud!!!  Don't be fooled by the modest price.  It can compete with higher priced amps.
854,How does the touch and resulting volume compare with a coventional piano.,"Not an expert, but the weighted keys give the feel of a standard piano, and the sound quality is very good, however, I did notice that on some of the higher notes, you can hear a bit of an echo, but it is faint and only hear it if you are playing those notes only for a long time."
855,How do I make this work with a 12 volt power supply in my vehicle? Not a/c,The controller takes a 12 supply form the wall wart power supply.  Just use the small round power connector and hook it to a 12 volt source and skip the wall wart completely.  I have used them many times on parade cars doing just that.  The wiring diagram is on the back of the unit.
856,Are the included cables xlr to 1/4 trs ?,No.        Included are 8- xlr M/F and 8- 1/4  male one end is straight and the other is an elbow.
857,Does this item come with the necessary cables? I have an iPhone 4 which has a large 30pin port on it.,"Yes, it comes with both kinds of cables, classic 30 pin and ""Lighting"" 8 pin."
858,"Can you hook up a midi keyboard via the USB. From the Detailed pictures it looks like you can, but one review says you can't.","You can't, even if you get an adapter it won't connect to the iPad. The USB port is only for transferring midi to and from a computer."
859,Which DMX controllers will work well with these lights?,I use Chauvet Obey 10 and it has been working for me.  The tricky part is setting the right address..
860,"Does this bundle actually included the Shock Mount? in the description it says it only comes with the mic, pop filter and xlr cable. I'm confused","Yes, shock mount is included."
861,Can I use this plugged into a DJ mixer?,"There are two methods of connection, and three  possible connection configuration. Two methods of connection: xlr, and 1/4"" . If you use xlr you get all four mics on one channel. If you use 1/4"" you can use two cables and have two mics  total on two separate channels, or you can you the 1/4"" to plug in to four channels separately. If your DJ micxer has the xlr and 1/4"" inouts then I do not see why you could not connect it to your mixer"
862,Can you store music from regular music CDs onto the Hard Drive and remove the vocals whenever you like?,"You can store regular CD tracks, however you cannot remove vocals from a regular CD disk, you would need Karaoke CD+G disks in order to have the background music and onscreen lyrics"
863,Does the 2013 generation Supcase have magnets for the auto sleep/awaken feature?,Yes it does.
864,Are these designed to be used one at a time or as a pair?,Either. We use them together one in the booth and one out of the booth.
865,"what are the parameters / radius of this light, and can it be on continuously",Yes it can. Its pretty small. About 10 inches but light is very powerful
866,"Does this support +48-volts Phantom Power? One reviewer says it doesn't, but the spec sheet I find just says it supports Phantom Power.",Yes the 402 VLZ4 supports +48v phantom power.
867,What kind of cord does this mic use,USB into a computer.
868,how about a 16 year old girl is the size alright for that?,"Sophia,This is a standard ""dreadnought"" size instrument.  Its the best selling size of acoustic guitar by far.  We would recommend this size instrument for most everyone from teens up unless they had very petite hands - in which case we might recommend a ""student"" sized instrument.  While not a perfect measurement (hands don't necessarily link to height - a competent guitar teacher would be best to insure), if the player is over 4' 6"" in height, they are fine with a dreadnought size guitar like the SA-50 which they can use for life.  Your Friends at EZPICKN"
869,What is the name of the tripod microphone stand that the bundle comes with?,Ultimate Support is the name on it...hope this helps :)
870,are these balanced together? - Thanks,"Hi Dean, when I purchased them, they came in a complete set of 2 power tubes and 3 preamp tubes.  Hope that helps. Regards,B."
871,Does this have a tuner built into it?,"Yes it does, but I don't like it. It's too sensitive. I would rather use my stand alone tuner."
872,"Help! Getting this for son's present. What else do I need other than cymbals, drumsticks, headphones,throne?","We got this last year for our sons for Christmas! It is an awesome starter kit, actually comes with a throne.  We purchased the Zildjan hi-tops/cymbals that were on sake last year and have since added a cowbell, and several different kinds of drumsticks, mostly Vic Firth.  Best wishes to you on this fun purchase!! Rock on!!"
873,Does it work with a sony HD handycam?,This mic requires the camera to power it. You will have to check with the manufacturer to see if the  mic input for the Sony Handycam can power such a device. The information is certainly available online as well. So just keep in mind that this microphone is not self powered. It must be powered by the device it is plugged into.
874,I prefer my microphone facing down slightly above my standing mouth level -can this be attached to a regular mic&boom stand to facilitate this set up?,"Thank you for your inquiry, and interest in our Monoprice Microphone Isolation Shield.  Unfortunately no that will not attach to a stand. it is meant to be used on a table surface for the most part. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to let us know."
875,What is the measurement of the maximum the clip can accommodate ? Will it work on a 2-inch picture frame?,"No, I don't think you could clip it on a 2"" wide frame. I would say the largest width it would fit is about 1.5""."
876,Do you ship worldwide? if Yes with wich company you ship?,USPS is the cheapest way to ship this item and yes we do ship worldwide
877,"In the picture it looks like this is a double strip, is that true? Is it 5050 but 600 LEDs (always two lights side by side?)","No, there is only one row of lights. However, they are quite bright. We install them as under counter lighting in kitchen and display lighting in display cases. Please 5050 LED you provide a perfect amount ambient light, however if you are looking for task lighting you may want to look at something a little bit brighter."
878,Is this an intermediate violin?,"No, I'd say strictly beginner."
879,I am looking to by this headset for an Iphone 5s,"After you use a good equalizer app, these headphones are pretty good to use with mobile phones. Especially good on plane rides and road trips for me."
880,Will this work with bass? I do not wanna get a fuzzy return.,"I use it with a bass, it works great."
881,what frequency does the ext sub function cut off at?,"Don't know if this helps, but the KSUB that is designed to be linked to this speaker has this for it's specifications:Frequency Response (-6 dB) 48 Hz - 134 HzFrequency Range (-10 dB) 44 Hz - 148 HzAlso from the manual for the K10:""When using one of the top boxes with a subwoofer, the switch should be moved to the ""EXT SUB"" position to engage the 100 Hz high-pass filter. It is also recommended that the 100 Hz high-pass filter be engaged when using the K10 or K12 as a floor monitor to prevent excessive bass build up on the stage""That's everything that you're told in the manual about the ext sub function.

882,"has anyone compared this with the Yamaha 20 series transparent-colored models? Is this exactly the same, or different in feel and tone?",I actually went to a music store to buy a soprano recorder and tried a transparent one like you described. I prefer the one I bought not because of difference in feel or tone but because of looks. I did not like the transparent recorder. It was also cheaper on Amazon.
883,is it good for overlaying harmonies and piano??,I used it for recording conversation for a skit and it was terrible. This is a cheap crap
884,Looking to get a mic for recording video on an iPad. Has anyone tried with this mic and if so what has been your experience.,"Its a decent product. The range is not very good and there is some small noise (most likely due to the long and thin cord. However, for the price it wasn't bad and it did a great job indoors. Outside though, make sure there is no wind or other ambient noise."
885,can I use this with my computer,"With this microphone, you will need an audio interface to enable a hook-up to your computer.  The audio interface, like a USB mixer, will enable you to plug in the XLR connector from the mic into the mixer and then output the signal to your computer via a USB cable.  I would suggest purchasing a USB microphone which will plug directly into your laptop or desktop.  The Blue  USB microphone was on sale at Amazon for $50 a few days ago.  The AT-2020 is also a good choice.  You'll then need a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) in order to edit, enhance, save your work.  There are free DAWs like Audacity and others that you can purchase.  I narrate books for Audible.com and used the AT2020 for narrating a number of books with good results.  There are better choices for a dynamic microphone than this PG48.  I purchased this mic earlier this year and found it to be very ""tinny""--not full bodied.  I returned the mic for a refund.

886,Does this serve as headphones and mic or just a mic?  If we're podcasting will we need headphones (or go w/out?)?,It serves only as a MIC...I bought it a few months back really sturdy and solid MIC too.
887,does it fit any sax,I Believe It Would For An Alto Sax.  Mine Is A Cannon Ball Large Bell.  Daughter is In College Band And Uses It On Her Bike And Walking. She Loves It !
888,Is it easier for people with small hands?,Yes it is. Im a gal with small hands and it works just fine :D
889,"Does a ""power Source"" come with the Machine ??","I bought mine used, of course, but it did come with an AC adaptor."
890,Will this work with the Roland Cube 40XL?,"I believe this would be unlikely to work well for that amp. The specs for a Roland Cube specify the use of a 1/4"" TRS cable (stereo cable) and this pedal is intended to work with a mono 1/4"" cable. To be safe, you would want to find a pedal that accepts or includes a stereo (TRS) cable in order to get the expected behavior for a Cube. I could be wrong though, as I've not played a Cube personally. Just going off of the specs Roland provides for the foot switch jacks on a Cube."
891,"Do these include both two of the Mopads and two of the related wedges, which allow a range of speaker angles from 8 degrees down to 8 degrees up?","It actually includes 4 Mopads plus the wedges that allow up to 8 degrees.  So you have enough to place two of everything depending on your needs under each speaker.  You can support two different speakers that way using two underneath each of them.  I have a really big Ascend Acoustics center speaker I just got and I am using just two of them to support it.  I have another two I am not even using at the moment.  Just to be clear I bought the option that says one pair, for two speakers."
892,What type of connector does it use?,A standard 3 prong  XLR mic cable (the male side)
893,could I put this pickup in the middle position with another one in the neck and a classic plus in the bridge?,"Yes, that would work fine. I have a 2-pickup guitar (Epiphone ES-175) and have identical Classic 57 pickups in each slot (neck and bridge); there is no need to have a different one for forward vs. rear. Some pickups have slightly different magnet pole spacings to more closely match the slightly different string spacings at those locations. But it is not really that much of an issue, at least for the Classic 57; the pickups pick up all strings just great. In your case, the middle pickup would be at a string spacing right in between that of the other two positions, so that would work out just fine as well. Putting the Classic Plus in the bridge will be nice, adding a bit more heat to that pickup. I sometimes wish I had done that, though I compensate a bit by raising the bridge pickup closer to the strings than the neck pickup.

895,"What is the difference between poly web and nano web?  Which is warmer, less bright?","Elixir Strings with NANOWEB Coating sound and feel more like traditional, uncoated strings. They are bright and lively, and the coating is so thin that you can barely tell it's there.Elixir Strings with POLYWEB Coating have a balanced tone. They sound like strings that have been perfectly ""played in"". They are comfortably smooth and help reduce finger squeak."
896,I have an old SL Q2...will this fit?  Looks very similar,Yes. It's the same head shell.

899,Connected to the CD player ok. I can't figure out how to connect  to the FM radio on my receiver. Any detailed suggestions appreciated. Thanks!,"There is no way to loop FM to the EQ back to the receiver because of the mode switch on the receiver, so you need a separate FM tuner. I run my CD player and laptop into my TV, and the TV into the EQ so I can listen to Pandora or youtube. Hope this helps."

903,Is it better to buy a right-angled or regular straight guitar cable?  The jack seems to be angled from the illustration.,We have a straight angle. My husband has several guitars. This was for our daughter so he just used what he had.
904,does it come with a base?,"No base, just an extra foam ""windscreen"" for the mic."
905,Will this fit in a Taylor 314ce?,Yes
906,"Does Jasmine sell a case for this? If not and you got a case, what did you choose?","Jasmine doesn't sell a case for this, but when I ordered my Jasmine s34c, i also ordered the Guardian CG-020-D Hardshell Case, and it fits nicely!"

911,Could this work on someone with index tip cut off and crooked tip on middle finger?,Yes would work good for them!
912,Does this Mic come with a cable that would plug into my laptop? If not can I buy one that is compatible? Thank you!,"It doesn't come with any cables.

I've used this product loads of times.HDE 10ft/3m XLR Female to USB 2.0 Cable Instruments/Microphones - Black"

916,What is the difference between this 312 and the 314 model?,"There are two differences that I've found. The most obvious is the color of the instrument. The 312 is simulated rosewood while the 314 is simulated ebony wood. The next difference is the sound of the instrument, specifically the color or the tone. It's kind of hard to put into words but one isn't better or worse than the other, just different (and not by much). I'd say you'd do fine w/ either the 312 or 314, but I'm more partial to my 314. Also, I'd recommend either the 312 or 314 over the 302 simply because of the texture. The 302 is smooth while the 312/314 have texture, making them easier to hold on to.

919,Will it work with a Casio WK 1300?,"I don't know, but it seems to work with other models which are not mentioned as compatible. It wouldn't surprise me if it actually worked. :)"
920,What speaker wire connection is on the back of these? Spring-loaded clips or banana plug? Thanks!,The ones I have use the spring loaded clips.
921,what is the projecting distance on this item ?,We bought it to use in a studio theatre type venue.  In a current play we are using it in the 50-60 foot range on a tri-pod.  I think it could be used easily in the 79-80 foot range also.
922,Does the Chromatic C tuner have a fob that can be attached to something?,"There is a hole that you could put a key ring through.  And it comes with a clip with a wrist strap (or there is one on mine that I believe came with it). The device works well. However, I admit that I've gone back to a combination of old-fashioned analog, wind-powered pitch pipe, and iPhone pitch-pipe apps. I find the tiny keys on the Farleys Pocket Tones a bit too small for my fingers and hard to press at times. Good luck."

924,What is the power source?,"If my memory is good, a 9 volt batterie or ac adapter. Gave it as a gift and got abigger one for me."
925,I purchased the guitar a month ago. Which strings should I purchase to replace?,"Taylor recommends Elixer, which I really like. They're the most expensive though. Martin strings are much cheaper, but good. D'addario also makes OK less expensive strings."
926,Could anyone be more specific about the sound system needed for these to work?  I want my daughter to be able to sing in them Christmas morning.,"I actually returned my hisonic wireless mics.  I didn't even get through one use and the mics quit working.  Maybe you will have better luck, I have dealt with several different brands, this was my least favorite.  For a sound system, it depends on what you want to do?  There is a Fender Passport system that is very portable and will put out a good sound for small gatherings, it has multiple inputs so you can plug in an MP3 player, computer or iphone to play music.  You can adjust the volume of the mic and music to get a good mix.  Major lesson, either put the speakers on a stand or something above peoples heads that way everyone can hear it.  If you put it on the floor, the sound will not travel through people and someone won't hear her.

927,Can this be used with acoustic guitars?,"Yes. The Marshall MS2 Micro Amp has very low noise even at volume setting up to 10. The Overdrive (OD) switch gives a rather clean Marshall-like sound, compared to Marshall heads from the late '70s (a major effort with Marshall amps then was noise reduction/control). In writing this response I tested one of my MS2 micro amps (I use two, for two effects channels then out through the headphone jack for 4 (two left two right) channels to the mixer board), and plugged in my Ovation-Celebrity CC57. I turned the volume of the Celebrity pickup to 10 (the pickup is very weak) and changed the volume on the MS2 from 0 to 10 (first test), and also engaged the OD switch (second test). Without the OD in play the quality of the sound was acceptable, i.e. just a clean acoustic guitar sound. With the OD in play the noise jumps and we get a kind-of Marshall-like sound from the weak pickup. So I can recommend using the Marshall MS2 Micro Amp even with an acoustic (i.e. acoustic-hybrid electric) guitar as a practice amp and as part of an effects system (pre-amp stage). And the MS2 is very inexpensive. Hope that helps.

928,will this automaticly adjust the frequencies?,"If you do the built in room correction, it will adjust with the pink noise signal - obviously this isn't perfect though, really just a starting point. What you really should do is ignore the room correction in this, and just use REW for measurements and make the appropriate changes on the DEQ."
929,"Hello, the description says that the finish is Matte, but on the product cover says Semi-gloss. Which is the actual finish of the product?",Semi-gloss.

I must add that this Danmar 925 castanets is a very fine set for the price, the strings, the finish and the sound are beautiful, I saw one of my friends playing this castanets and I order a set, this sounds as good as a $300.00  pair made from grenadilla wood from Spain.

932,"I played one, and the holes are extremely far apart. Is this true of all alto recorders, regardless of the material used to make one?",This is the only alto recorder I've ever had.  The holes are WAY too far apart for me to play.  I gave it away to someone with bigger hands.  I've gotten an Irish tin whistle and am trying to learn that.
933,What is the Height on this product?? I saw the Width but I didn't see the Height ...... I appreciate if somebody response me,Up to 10'
934,How long is the remote control cord that comes with the device?,the remote cord is roughly 8 feet long and the power cord is 6 feet long
935,What would be the best way to get a balanced output? Use an XLR combiner cable or? We currently have a balanced TRS output from our old mixer.,This mixer uses XLR for main outputs but also has balanced TRS outputs for control room outs and Aux sends. If you can't solder your own XLR connectors you could buy a couple of these: Hosa GXJ-183 Balanced 1/4 - Inch Female to XLR Female Adaptor
936,Does this product come calibrated and ready to use?,Yes
937,Does this matchup with the Line 6 M9 pedal?,NO!
938,Can you just plug this into a computer or does it need to go through a sound board?,"It requires an audio analog-to-digital interface of some kind to be used with a computer, like a sound card or the Balance peripheral from Propellerheads. The interface needs to be able to provide 48V phantom power to the mic. Most do, and all will say whether they do or not in the specs. I use an Echo Gina 3G interface, which is pretty serviceable. It has a card that you have to install in the motherboard and then a cable that connects to a ""breakout box"" which has the XLR connections to receive input (and provide phantom power) to the mic. Other interfaces go through USB or FireWire. Only use USB those if the interface supports USB 3.0, or else your latency will likely be hard to manage (you'll hear a noticeable delay between when you sing into the mic and what you hear from the monitors or headphones, which can cause real problems with your timing when you record). Basic quality hierarchy for home recording on a computer is this: 1) PCI-card interface (fastest, takes most technical skill to install, but not a whole lot, really, and nearly every desktop computer has a slot open). 2) USB 3.0 interface (you plug the mic into a box and the box into your computer). 3) Firewire interface (same thing). 4) USB 2.0 interface (depending on the age of your computer this may be all you have, apart from PCI.) 5) Microphone with USB cable built in (probably okay for amateur stuff, but I've not heard of any professionals using these. Maybe they've gotten better since I was shopping for them. If you get one, get USB 3.0 if you have the ports, because LATENCY)! Hope this helps!

939,What usb cord will i need?,"The USB cable is include with the Tascam. it's a USB type A Male to B Male Cable (standard). When the software is installed, it's ready to go... microphone, guitar, keyboard, recorded with any audio software! working very well, easy to use!"
940,does it fit the ikea rast,"Yup, I bought two sets and slapped them both in a rast bedside no problem.  Just needed a few additional screw to attach them to the inside of the wood, but the fit is perfect with no modifications.   Lemme know if you have any other q's (nsafchuk@hotmail.com)"
941,"This thing only adds distortion to my acoustic guitar, no matter how I have it set.  is it defective?",Probably not.  Does your guitar have an on board preamp by any chance?
942,"Does it run on batteries? If not, is there a way to make it portable and run without ac/dc wired current?",It runs on 110v AC - plugs into a normal wall outlet.  I don't see any way to run it without a source of 110V AC.
943,what is the difference between slinky and non slinky?,"Short answer: marketing. For the real story see the Ernie Ball website, but if you trust my memory... many, many moons ago there were few guitar string makers and they pretty much made the same thing- strings that helped a guitar be heard in a Big Band environment. The Ernie Ball company was one of the first to start marketing ""boutique strings"" that were easier for the player to fret and to bend. Compared to other strings at the time (anybody remember Black Diamonds?) the word ""slinky"" pretty much described how they felt."
944,Do I have to have a humbucker guitar to use this or can I use this with a sigle coil guitar too?,"The Ebow does not require any pickups, actually. All that is required is that your strings have some ferrous metal (containing iron) content, which most, aside from nylons, will. This means that you can use this not only on an electric with silgles or humbuckers, but also on acoustics, basses, and the infinite number of other steel-stringed instruments."
945,I want to do some recording for podcast. We will be sitting around a table. Using a mix board and headphones. Do you think these mics would be decent?,"Yes, these mics should do a pretty decent job."
946,what is a string type for beginners?,"You didn't say if this is for Electric, Classical, or regular Acoustic guitar.  This answer is for the acoustic.  The short answer is to get wrapped silk strings.  They take less pressure on the bass strings and are thus easier to play.  That said, if your guitar doesn't sound good with those, you won't want to practice.  I would get something light, like the D'Addario light string and build strength by practicing more often rather than longer at one time."
947,the short description says it's for steel string guitars. the long description says steel or nylon. do you have an opinion on this for nylon string?,It is only for steel string guitars.
948,"Will this work, out of the box on its own?  Or do I need to purchase an amp. This is for a 4 year old and 6 year old as a toy","Yes, you need an amp. I bought this for my grandson when he was about four.  I bought an inexpensive amp at Guitar Center.  It cost about 20 dollars and looked like a mini juke box.  It worked well and still works.  The microphone has held up, too.  My grandson just turned 9.  He and his young friends enjoyed the mike and amp very much and improvised pretend music with books such as a Richard Scary."
949,I heard this can record through the Bose L1. Is this true?,"By record, I assume you mean record the output.  The Tonematch has plenty of OUTPUTS that can be routed to a recorder, so yes."
950,could i hook this into my mixer if so what type of cable would I need and how would i do it,"your mic or instrument 1/4"" cable goes into the pedal, and the other 1/4"" cable would go out of it into a channel of the mixer."
951,"Is your Boom wobbly when you put it in the desk clamp?It has too much room in the mounting hole, it wobbles from side to side, is that normal?","Actually, there must be something extraordinary taking place. I am using the clamp as you mentioned and it is a relatively tight fit without a lot of wobble.  There is supposed to be a brass/bronze bushing in the hole in the clamp, if it is no there then it would be very wobbly.Hope this helps."
952,Can I hook this up to my home stereo ? If so how all I have is input/output for the speakers and an RCA plug for the subwoofer. I'm not a DJ or Musician by the way.,"Yes, you can use for home stereo. It works like a BBE Sonic Maximizer will enhance the sound and make it better, it likes a boost for high's and low's (almost like an equalizer) depending on how you adjust the knobs. You have to use RCA to PHONO or to XLR cables since it does not have RCA jacks. Use it between your players/pre-amp L/R before to amplifier. For the price, I would recommend you to buy it. If you have more budget, you can get something more expensive like BBE... but then.. this is good enough to make a different. I have this for over 3 years and it still working like new, never had any problems.

962,How would this work on an acoustic to make it sound like a twelve string?,"I play almost exclusively electric and the only acoustic I play is bluegrass, so I don't have a lot of experience with acoustic amplification. This device may help you a little bit, but it's probably not what you want. This is a very ""electronic"" device that relies on a strong, consistent signal like an electric guitar. If the signal decays too quickly, as tends to be the case with an acoustic guitar, the processed signal will simply drop out altogether. The ""Detune"" setting, which is what I think you're asking about, produces a nice, jangly, quasi-Rickenbacker sound, but it's a bit of a stretch to compare it to a real twelve string. (Having said that, I'll also say that it is definitely my favorite feature of this device.) However, I have noticed that most acoustic amplifiers (including the inexpensive ones) have built in chorus settings. To my ear, the Detune feature sounds very similar to a chorus pedal with my Telecaster. If you already have an acoustic amp with chorus, then you're probably already getting what this pedal would do for you. Plus, your acoustic amp is designed to maximize the sound of an acoustic guitar, whereas this pedal is designed for electric guitars. I hope this helps.

983,Does it have a truss rod in the neck?,"Yes, it does. It's at the bottom of the neck, inside the sound hole."
984,Could this work as a gaming microphone?,Yes i use it for my youtube videos! This is a very good microphone and I highly recommend it!
985,"Ipurchased this product and did all of my down loads and up dates, my problem is, I am not getting an output from my computer, can anyone help me with","Open Maschine, go up to 'File', 'Audio and MIDI Settings...' under device choose 'built-in' if you want it to come thru you computers internal speakers of headphone out. If you have an interface plugged in that should also show up under devices."
986,I want this for my 9.1 HTsystem to give extea power to my klipsch rf-7ii's. The av is an onk 929 with  pre-amp output. Is this overkill?,"I would strongly recommend against that setup.  One of the distinguishing features of any Klipsch speaker is their amazing sensitivity.  The rf-7ii are a great example at 101db's.  So, using a bruiser amp like the Behringer is completely unnecessary for achieving any goal.  If you need them to go louder or just want more headroom for sound quality then I would suggest looking in the home amplifier arena.  I have married pro audio with home audio before and its great if you are just going for huge sound for like a party in a big hall or something...but you need to use line level from your pre-amp to this pro amp and the volume increments will not line up as precise as you might like.  Since you dont need a ton of power for these Klipsh speakers I would look for a solid home amplifier to just take RCA's straight from you pre-amp.  I think you will be more happy.  NOTE: the fan on this amp will be really annoying in a home set-up.

987,Is this violin good for beginners?does it sound good ?,"Hard to tune, the strings are low quality so it doesn't hold. Any player, especially beginners, will have a hard time tuning this violin!"
988,Does this include the free upgrade to Ableton Suite 9 when it is released?,"Yes it does, right after I registered it though the Ableton website, I got an e-mail letting me know that they will send me a download link for Live 9 as soon as it is available."
989,"What would I order to hang them from a ceiling, and do you have the hardware?  I can order through Amazon? or?","I'm using professional PA speaker stands from Pyle. If you want to permanently mount them to the ceiling, you'll need to create a custom rig. These are designed to be portable. Even out putting them on the ground is an effective solution."
990,How does this collapse? do the feet fold down toward the center and make it easy to store in a violin case?,"Yes, the feet fold in toward the center. It fits nicely into the violin case."
991,why a battery? Does it have to be electric????,It is acoustic/electric with a uk-2000 pickup built into the side. You do not actually need the battery to run the pickups unless you decide to use them.
992,is the headset adjustable to fit different sizes of heads?,Part goes over the ear and the bulk of the unit rests back on your neck. Fully adjustable so that your kids could wear it.
993,Does the fog created smell bad or overwhelming?,it does have a slight odor but I'm sure it will depend on the fluid used.I've not used mine inside a building but im sure it can be donemine has been used at football games with great sucess
994,stick to a satin finish?,"Yes my ukulele has a satin finish, it sticks well most of the time. If your using it for practice its great, I would never use it for a live performance as every once in a while it will pop off randomly but usually only once or twice a session."
995,Does this kit come with a shoe mount adapter (CA2 Shoe Mount Adapter)?,Yes it does
996,"What are the actual dimensions of this item? I see it's 5 lights, but what is the thickness, depth, and length?",it is on the boat in storage but I would say about the size of your pinky finger
997,I want to use these in a bar that is about 25ft X 25ft. for karaoke and DJ dance music.  Is it enough speaker to fill that space?,"These speakers are loud enough for your applications but you might need a powered subwoofer to give you some bass especially for dance music. You will also need the ""On Stage EB9760 Exterior Speaker Mounting Bracket"" if you are planning to mount it in a speaker stand."
998,I'm looking for an amp that will help me to learn to play the blues. Would this be a good option to get BB King type tones please?,"The key is in your fingers, but I would say that with a Les Paul style axe set for the bridge pup, and the amp set with not too much gain, I can get some BB tone. Again, gear helps, but it's your mojo that's important. (But I do like this amp.)"
999,"Can I use 12 meters with one 30 Watt LED Power Suppply Driver Transformer? If I want dimmable, what kind of  Transformer dimmable? 60w, 100w?","The specifications for the 5Meter LED light strip states each requires 12V and 24 Watts, this means that each 5 meter array draws 2 Amps.  The specs also state that each strip must be wired separately not in series, because the internal printed wiring cannot handle more current than each strip requires.  This means each strip would require a separate wire running back to the supply if you want to use a single power supply (transformer).  If you were going to use a single power source you should select one that will supply the 24 watts for each or the two and a half strips you plan to use.  The total would be 24 X 2.5 = 60Watt, to add a safety factor I'd just use a 100W supply and a dimmer of an equal size.  The hook up wires can be 24 guage wires, red and black are the standard colors and Amazon sells 50 foot rolls fairly cheaply.  One set of wires will be needed from the power supply to the dimmer and then a separate wire from the dimmer to each of the light strips.  I have not had any problems with the light strips, I left the lamps rolled up on the spool to increase the heating, ran the strips at 15V to increase the stress even further and let them run for over a month, no failures in any of the sets I've used.  I cut the strips to the  lengths needed and converted many of the Light in my RV.  The power draw for the lights was reduced by two thirds, not bad when your camping on battery power.  Well have fun, practice up on your soldering, the contacts are small, but doable, Good Luck, Have Fun

I originally was going to go to the music store with her teacher to find one that fit her and her instrument; however, upon putting the Everest on the 4/4 violin, everyone agreed that the Everest shoulder rest was great fit and very soft to her jaw/shoulder position when she plays.  Please feel free to let me know how it works for your viola because a few of my daughter's classmates are using the Everest or sponges until they can get an Everest/or music store shoulder rest for themselves.

1003,My son has a fender strat.  Some of the reviews say that this type of guitar won't  work with this holder.  Have you tried it with this type of guitar,It Works on any Guitar and I have 20 guitars No Problem!
1004,do you need a computer to work this?  can you use it independantly?  is there a headphone jack?  does it record?,"Yes, you need a computer.  This is a controller, just like your mouse or computer keyboard, but used for generating MIDI control signals in music software.  There is no headphone jack nor does it record since it only produces control codes and not any kind of audio."
1005,"If I want to project onto the ceiling, where's the best height and angle to put the projector?

We built a fantasy submarine in our Kids Church. One end of the room has a very large (5 ft. Diameter) port hole.

1007,Can you mic your guitar thru VL3G instead of using a pickup?,"I'm sure the device would understand the harmony coming through the mic, however the guitar input is only a quarter inch plug. There is no 3 pin cannon mic input. Maybe some kind of direct box or preamp would adapt for you."
1008,Does it come with a foot switch?,"No, foot switch is extra."
1009,Would you recommend this for a committed beginner?,"Yes.  This set will be perfect if you're a committed beginner, as it has all the necessary functions of a dual deck, cross fader, and an additional input for a mic or aux line.  The NS7fx effects bar has some essential effects, but from here you can graduate to the ns7 II if you need more professional effects, and 4 channels."

1018,if i am getting this for a 13yr old for christmas --- she plays keyboard and piano. Will she like this and what else do I need to order with it?,"It completely depends on what she wants to do with it. To me, there are not enough keys to make it any sort of adequate substitute for a full piano, using two hands. It's generally intended to be slung around the shoulder and played with the right hand only. It's not self amplified, so it needs to be connected to some sort of powered speaker, unless you use it exclusively with headphones. That being said, I think the sounds and the physical keyboard touch are nice. If it were me, I might look for something like a Yamaha YPG 235 instead. More keys, self amplified, meant to be played with two hands, many sounds, accompaniment features. My own opinion only!

Try to get a 4 ohm total load to the amp (A pair of 4-ohm/coil DVCs will do it). 400-600wrms subs with a low Q would be ideal for your application. These amps have awesome crossovers (24db/oct) built in. Cheers

1021,"If you don't have an angled jack, does the cable bump the sides of the bag when plugged into the left or right-most pedals?","No, because both sides of the bag have openings for the cables (with velcro). The bag is great."
1022,I have a rather limited use for recording software. I want to make professional quality recordings of books I've written. Is this version adequate?,"Terris, I purchased the software to manage voice recordings made on a Sony digital recorder.  Subsequently, I've used an earbud microphone/recorder (Olympus TP-8 Telephone Pick-up Microphone by Olympus) to make recordings of phone calls dealing with detailed instructions of how to handle tax matters.  The number of options outside of my needs are numerous.  Keeping in mind that I use the software to ""edit"" voice recordings off of a digital recorder and a couple of technical phone conversations, my guess is that you will have no problems with the software and will be please with it.  Beyond this software, Sony has a number of higher end sound products that would allow you to do studio recording quality.  Here's my suggestion:  buy the software and play with it for ten minutes - record for 5 minutes or so and edit for the remainder of the time.  My guess is that you'll be pleased enough to continue using the software.  As your understanding of what your needs are and what offerings are available, you can step up.  My version predates the current version and is on sale for $24.  Spend $24 and give it a spin.  What you do not want is to buy a full blown complicated software when you just want to record your book.  In summary, I'm pleased since the software more than meets my needs and was very easy to learn to do what I wanted it to do.

1025,My unit isn't working. How do I activate the warranty?,"If you bought it in the last 30-days or so Amazon will probably handle it, or the company selling it through Amazon. If you have had it longer than that you probably need to contact Peavey. Hopefully you filled out your warranty card and sent it in."
1026,What exactly does this Footswitch do?,"When clicked, this foot pedal switches between the 2 channels on your amp (if you have a 2 channel amp) I have a Crate, and when I click it goes from the clean channel to the overdrive channel.

I think it was well worth the investment."
1029,Can you record tracks 1-8 while listening to tracks 9 & 10?,"Yes, you can listen to all other tracks that are not recording. Just need to select tracks 9-16 and set the ones you want to listen and volumes, later set back 1-8 and prepare them to record.As Eroach said bfore, the only thing is that you may record max 08 simultaneously , due to the limited inputs (08)"

1034,"Where do you apply this, to the inside or outside of the case. I have a few 4-drive raid enclosures that hum when not touched.","Typically you apply to the inside of the case, it helps to absorb the noise coming from inside making it more difficult for the metal to transfer the sound to the outside.  I would imagine it would still work on the outside but possibly not as well."
1035,"would this stand fit Gemini Rs-415 15"" 1200 Watt Professional Powered 2 Way Bi-amped Loud Dj Pa Speaker System with Abs Cabinet.","I'm still builting my system so I didn't use the moniror stand, if your speaker weights more that 100lb it mine be a problem ."
1036,Using the USB interface can you record every track separate in your DAW or are you stuck with the 4 outputs?,"you can record 16 separate tracks in and listen to 4 tracks out all at the same time, depending on how you configure cubase. Also the ""separate"" monitor out is just 1 and 2 with a volume knob up front. Dose that answer your question?"
1037,Do you think it'd be ok for a 6 year old? (my gut says no but it might be the side of me that treats my ocarinas as if they were my children...),"I would say yes, if he or she is being supervised or sitting down. It is heavy glass so  sure with one drop it will break. It's such a cool little gadget I say go for it!"
1038,"I want to use the instrument correction, will it still work if I set it at the beginning of my (guitar) pedal board chain, or do I keep it separate?","Yes, that's the best place to connected it into the pedal chain. Usually just after the tuner if you are using one. Good luck."
1039,Will this fit a DigiTech RP500 Integrated-Effects Switching System,"Gary - I also wanted to check the size for you. The inside measurements are 21 1/2 inches wide by 11 inches deep - the height is not going to be an issue. So, if your RP falls within those parms, you'll be good to go."
1040,My turntable has very quiet output. Will this device help boost the volume?,"Yes, indeed. If your need was like mine (no built-in pre-amp on the turntable and no specifically dedicated phono input on your amplifier) you will find this unit to be the perfect solution to needed amplification of the turntable's output. Don't forget to hook up the ground wire as directed or you may wind up putting unwanted noise into the audio."
1041,how come its so noisy?its humming continuously,"It does hum but most amplifiers do because of the way it is constructed. One way of addressing the humming is to make sure that the volume is not too loud and the effects are set so that they are not ""maxed out"". This amp is a practice amp and should not be mistaken as a stage or heavy duty amp. I use mine for a PA because it has very limited capacity but the clarity for voice is good enough in a small hall. I don't run my keyboard on it because the sound is very ""teeny."" It is a great amp for the price and what I use it for."
1042,"so, i have the mic, plugged it into my ipad/iphone  i have no sound...  what am I missing??  Is anything else required?","Have you downloaded the iRig Recorder app? And once you do, have the app open on your device when you're recording, even when recording video through the camera on your phone or tablet."
1043,Is this a nylon-string or a steel-string guitar ?,It is a steel stringed guitar.
1044,does it come with the USB cord?,"Yes, it hooks right in to you computer."
1045,need SAME frequency unit: either 501A/509/a507B/513B OR 503A/509B/521A/521B to MATCH ones I already have,"Gary hit it on the head.  You can do it yourself, but contact the company and provide the frequency and they will pre-program the unit before sending it."
1046,How loud are the drums themselves? Not the electronic volume - how loud is the acoustic sound of hitting the pads/cymbals?,They aren't terribly loud but you will hear tapping from the other room. If I don't wear earbuds while playing and just use regular headphones it can be more difficult to hear the electronic volume over the tapping unless I turn it up a lot more.
1047,whats the weight in grams of this bow,I do not know....but i do like the weight.   I would say medium to medium-Light weight compared to my other bows.
1048,Will this pedal work with a casio WK-220?,"The answer is yes!  It works very well.  The petal can be placed exactly where you are comfortable with it.  It is heavy so it stays put, it does not slide around, and it is large enough to accommodate the front half of your foot.  It works perfect."
1049,Does this case stay open when putting the instrument into it? Or does it tend to fall closed in the process?,My daughter has this one and she has had no issues with it closing on her when she has it open. I can take a pic of it open this afternoon if that would help you.
1050,Will it work with Mac Mountain lion OS X,I'm using it on a 2011 mac book pro (2.2GHz Core i7) with OS X 10.8.2 (lion) and it works flawlessly.
1051,Which yamaha adapter goes with this keyboard?,Yamaha PA130 120 Volt Keyboard AC Power
1052,Can this tune an electric bass without having to plug it to an amp?,"Yes it can. Actually That's how it was designed to work. Just clamp it to the headstock, turn it on and tune. I'm a bass player and that's how I tune."
1053,"Does it come with all the software  KOMPLETE ELEMENTS, CUBASE LE 6, TRAKTOR LE 2, $30.00 e-voucher?","Yes.

1054,does it come with the drum key?,Yes it does.
1055,Will this fit GN93CE Cutaway style?,No
1056,"Will this harmonizer work with only a voice in the mic, or does it require a guitar or other input? Thanks, Dean","You can manually select the Major Key with the left hand dial (or the Minor key, if you hold the foot-switch down).  So, you don't need to use the guitar input, but you'll need to manually set the song key each song."
1057,I need to fix mine that I bought some months ago. Where I can get it? Is there warrant period?,whats wrong?what heppend with instrument?
1058,Is the fingerboard fully arched or is it 'ramped' on one side? Is the bridge a standard acoustic bridge with the pickup mounted between the feet?,"I believe it is fully arched, my first instrument.  The pickup in mounted inside the cello, with the bridge sitting on top.  If you look at the photo of the bridge, you will notice a black piece(black heat shrink?) with white writing.  That is the pickup."
1059,"If I install it on my current computer and upgrade to a different computer (like I am planning to), will I have to buy another copy of the software?","I don't believe so. if you purchase any software from anyone it will be the same. Keep all of your paperwork, activation codes etc and usually any company will allow you to use it on at least 2 computers. I think I have it on 3 at present. This one is pretty tough to learn. I haven't had time or the inclination to invest in learning it."
1060,Does this produce a strong physical vibration? It seems everyone's talking about the sound only.,"You can feel the vibration and hear the sound, for me there is usually a following improvement in inflamation of area where tuning fork touches."
1061,Hello everybody. I have some questions about this item : do it have nice voice for playing ?? I' playing guitar 4 years.,"Hello! I got Valencia CL-160 couple of months ago. Honestly, I'd rather pay two times more and get a cheaper version of Cordoba or Yamaha. (I have Yamaha 3/4 and it sounds brilliant).The guitar is rough and sound like a piece of wood. Strings are too high and you can't adjust them because there is no key hole. Electronic part  is very cheap - the sound is awful. As usual: you're getting what you payed. Sorry for such a negative comment!"
1062,Which is the weight of the cello with the hard case?,"Hi.  After conferring with my son, the cello player, he approximates the weight of cello and hard case to be no more than 30 pounds.  The weight of the case will depend greatly on what you put in this case....in addition to the cello.  Bow, rosin, tuner, extra strings, and music will add weight to this case.  This case should have wheels, which makes it quite easy to move around.  Good luck!  Hope you enjoy your new cello!"
1063,Will this arm need any sort of adapter to work with the Blue YETI?,"Blue Yeti will screw in without an adapter where the shock mount is screwed in. That means the shock mount that comes with this becomes a knickknack. Blue Yeti does not fit in the shock mount. With that said it seems to not need the shock mount but that depends on what is on the table you have this secured. If you  have motors like a hard drive or computer or so on the hum may make its way up the arm and be heard in the mic. But that is going to be true what ever table you place the Blue Yeti regardless of having it on an arm. Then this comes with a XLR connector and cable fished inside the arms metal so that is its not removable. So that becomes unused and dangles. So you will need to secure it with tape or a tie. Bottom line, yes, but two features, the XLR cable and connector plus the shock mount are not needed. Finally this arm is stiff particularly the swivel at the base. So the image of the radio talk show host freely moving the arm around is out the window. It moves but with the idea it will stay in place or within a small range once you do. You can move it but it resists and sometimes can require care to to force against the resistance especially in the swivel, less so in the retraction. The resistance in the retraction is good because you do not want it to sag due to weight. So it seems to hold this mic without sagging.

1064,Where can I find a list of sounds in the tone bank that I can print out?  I am stunned that it is not in the manual or easily findable on the web.,Go to http://support.casio.com/manualfile.php?rgn=2&cid;=008011145.  Click on appendix and download.  This should have come with your keyboard.
1065,Is a mic stand clip included?,No
1066,those this come with everithing seen ?,Yes
1067,"Hello, I wonder what is the voltage of this amp, 120V or 220V? Thank you.","Hi, the voltage is 120V"
1068,What materials can this cut?  Can you cut a thin metal with it?,We've used it on a variety of plastic materials. Would you want metal picks?
1069,Can you use a collar clip-on lapel microphone with it?,"My Dear French Lady: Yes, you can use a clip-on microphone as long as it has the correct size male jack to plug in to the unit. The microphone my wife uses with hers is a lapel clip-on. We bought it from Amazon at the same time we bought the amplifier.   Most sincerely"
1070,would this item work plugged into a pc with windows 8,"I would believe so, I use it on my Mac for Garageband and Ableton. I would think it would work, but I don't have a computer with windows 8 to be 100% sure. Sorry I couldn't more concrete."
1071,Does this product come with a software CD or is the software downloaded from a site with a keycode or something like that?,Yes it does come with software trakktor
1072,Hi... could you please confirm that is made in Mexico?,The model I bought was made in Mexico
1073,Is there a sustain pedal jack ?,"Not sure, but this keyboard is junk. Only lasted a few days"
1074,Is this a set of  6 or just 1?,It's a set of six. It also comes with the proper amount of tiny screws.
1075,"Could us turn off the light for showing the correct key, when we do not want it on?","Yes, the lights can be turned off.  It's a pretty amazing keyboard."
1076,Can this be used with a Sennheiser E835 on an iPhone 5 to record videos? I really want excellent audio...,"The question is what is your plug... it has a 3 point microphone standard... and 1/4"" jack in one plus you can find an adapter that fits into the 3 point so you can do mini jacks... it also has phantom power... so, I don't think it is a problem. The only problem I have experienced with it is that you cannot ""listen in the ear phone"" when you are recording which is a feature I really wanted for video as well... it isn't 100% the kind of device you would hope for."
1077,which digital to analog audio converter can I use to connect wireless headphones to my HDTV?,"I don't have a good answer for wireless headphones, as I've never used a pair. I use a relatively cheap audio mixer to convert the stereo output to something I can plug my headphones into: Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel MixerNote that this expects a 1/8"" inch audio jack to be plugged in, not a 3.5mm. Standard on premium headphones, not what you'd typically have plugged into an mp3 player. It allows for good control over the volume that comes out.My speculation is that most wireless headphones would just directly accept the stereo audio out. In that case you'd be fine with just this.

1078,Can you use the Mixtrack while it's still in the case?,The case has been designed so that you can use the MixTrack while in the case.  In fact it raises it up off the table to a comfortable level to work.  Very well built case.
1079,"Mine came locked, where are the keys?!",Lol... inside the case!
1080,can I use 7 inputs at the same time?,only 6
1081,is there a usb connection on this?,No
1082,What Chakra musical note is it tuned to? Why do the sing bowls not have MP3 file to listen too?,I tried to get a reading from my guitar tuner and it rings almost perfect key of A. Which should be 3rd eye Chakra. It is a fantastic bowl. Great sound and nice looking.
1083,Is there any issues with getting the unused bubble solution out of the machine after each usage? I only use the machine for a couple minutes a night &,"We pour the unused fluid back into the jug, and then put water into the machine and run it with water in it to help rinse everything out, including the wands.  When we put fluid into the machine, it is normally in it for 6-7 hours, then clean it as we said. (we actually run it on and off for about 30 minutes total)"
1084,is this an E12 model because Buffet doesn't make E11 Bb clarinet models,as an e11 owner i can confidently say that this is an e11  Bb clarinet
1085,what is this made of?  (Wood? Plastic?),"It is made of wood.  I don't know much about mandolins, but to me it seemed of a very good quality.  My son plays guitar, and I bought this as a Christmas gift for him as something new to try.  I showed it to my co-workers when it arrived, and they were also impressed.  Hope this helps you."
1086,Are the cymbals included in this set?  Is this set the appropriate size for an adult?,Nope.  That's why I sent them back.
1087,how does this piano sound?,Natural piano sound is excellent especially with a little reverb. Also the church organ and harpsichord sounds are brilliant. I'm very impressed.
1088,Do the ear buds fit well and stay in while running and sweating?,"I bought a set for my wife, she's a runner.  She no longer uses the bose in-ear or the shure over the ear headphone...only these.  So, I guess....yeah :)."

1091,Are these for RGB or RGB plus white?  I don't see it in the description anywhere but one of the pictures looks like a 5 wire.,I believe they work...I got the multi color LED and picked up the 12ft  strips...they worked for me
1092,"""Visual metronome"" - does that mean it doesn't make any kind of tone? I'd like to hear a beep or something...",Yes
1093,I have never gotten to play a keytar so I have a few questions.1. Does this product have different sounds on it? Like different instruments?,"This particular one has no sounds, it's just a MIDI controller, set up to control another keyboard that you would already have."
1094,Is this compatible with other Traktor based products like the T1 controller or do the native instrument accessories only work with the s4/s2?,"I have the Traktor F1 controller and it works fine with the 4Trak. Is there a T1 in the product range of Native Instruments (Traktor), I don't seem to find it?"
1095,Hello.  What is included in purchase? does it come with carrying case?,"You get a carrying case, the short pipe for playing like a traditional wind instrument, and a long flexible hose pipe to play it on a table or your lap like a keyboard.  A hand strap under the product is used to hold it when playing it like a wind instrument.  I have been very satisfied with mine and use it on songs that require harmonica or accordion.  It sounds a little like both!"
1096,it have the shoulders straps?,"Yes it does.  Its a cheapie gigbag though, only offering minimal protection."
1097,Does this device connect to amplefiers od PA gear?,"You would just use the 3.5 mm headphone jack to connect to any external speakers, amp, PA, recording equipment etc."

Show Less","Hi Fred, the DP-24 is not easy to use unless you have experience using different digital recorders and/or software. I have used quite a few different devices and software, and still occasionally I need to refer back to the manual when using my DP-24. It gives great quality recordings if you are willing to invest the time learning how to use it. If you're looking for something simple, I would recommend starting with one of their smaller portastudios (see http://tascam.com/applications/musician/mtr_digital_portastudio/). A lot depends on how many channels you want to record at a time. If it's just you, and you want to record 1 or 2 channels at a time, go with one of their smaller devices, it will be simpler, and you will probably find no difference in sound quality and you will save hundreds of dollars.

1099,Will this guitar fit for women?,"It should.  I bought it for my grandson who is only 10 years old, and his mother is using it now, too!  Both are average sized."
1100,I just got 2 of these and there is a hum which increases when the master volume goes up. I am using the unbalanced input; should I use the XLR to fix?,"I do not have such and I also use RCA input. Please check first if something affecting wires, in my case I had issues with power adapter for notebook, I had to replace it with other one."
1101,Would Magix Audio Cleaner be suitable for professional V.O. projects?,I use Magix only for voice as I record audio books for Blackstone Publishing. I haven't tried voice over but I have mixed musical loops for chapters. Magix has a record function and a mixer so V O is can be used. I'm happy with this this program - for the money it works quite well.
1102,"How many straps does this bag have?  It says detachable backpack straps, but I didn't want to assume 2 straps!",It has 2 detachable backpack straps and an attached handle.   It makes a crinkly sound because of the lining which I've read that some people found troubling.  No big deal to me.  I love it and it's protected my uke beautifully.
1103,How do I reduce the feedback and static when plugged in?,"I have not used mine at all, I actually have it for sale due to a job loss. However, the one day I did try it out I found I you don't plug your IPhone into the charger at the top, and just run the machine off of its battery it takes away that buzz."
1104,Does it fit an IPAD AIR,"Ionic Rotating Stand Leather Case with SLEEP AND WAKE Functiontion - according to Apple's website, the iPAD Air is a different size than the previous iPADs.  See https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/   So I don't think that this case will fit the iPAD Air."
1105,Will this work good for podcasting?,"We are using it for podcasting, and it works fine. Due to the fact that it is a dynamic microphone, it doesn't pick up background noise as a condenser microphone typically will. However, it is of my opinion that you get what you pay for here. It is great value for the money, but a more expensive mic, like the Rode Procaster or Podcaster (if you want USB connectivity) will give you better sound. You really should avoid holding it while recording, as it picks up noise from hand movements. Also, I have found that it requires a bit of power - while using it with an iPad, it records in low volume. And watch out for popping; you should buy a windshield for it.All in all: If you are on a budget; buy it! Great value and ok sound. If you have the money, buy the Rode Podcaster, for example.For further information and sound samples, you can go to this page: http://recordinghacks.com/2013/03/13/atr2100-usb-and-at2005usb-a-closer-look/

You really should avoid holding it while recording, as it picks up noise from hand movements. Also, I have found that it requires a bit of power - while using it with an iPad, it records in low volume. And watch out for popping; you should buy a windshield for it.All in all: If you are on a budget; buy it! Great value and ok sound. If you have the money, buy the Rode Podcaster, for example.For further information and sound samples, you can go to this page: http://recordinghacks.com/2013/03/13/atr2100-usb-and-at2005usb-a-closer-look/

1106,Do they have protection bags for this awesome looking speakers?,"No , they come alone , but they are awesome speakers  you wont want to  put them into a protection bag ,,"
1107,Does this bag have dividers for each cymbal so they don't scratch ?,"Yes, it's like a little bag inside the big bag. 5 cymbals can be separated."
1108,can I layer tracks to make into one song with this recorder,"Definitely! Like any professional portable audio recorder you can record individual tracks in either mp3 or wav format and bring them into any audio program like pro-tools, to layer them, mix and export a finalized audio track. However, if your question is whether you can do that directly from the recorder, no not really. You would always get a better mix from a stand alone audio program like pro tools anyway. Hope this helps!"
1109,what is the material that the ocarina is made of?,"Basic ceramic with a metallic glaze, I'm pretty sure."
1110,does it comes with the vinyls and cds control and also the traktor scratch 2 software with the license?,Yes Mine came with TRAKTOR SCRATCH DUO 2 SoftwareCONTROL CD x2CONTROL VINYL x2Driver Software CD-ROM
1111,What color is it really?Brown or red and interior? What are the dimensions inside? I have an L50 Acoustic Archtop Gibson and want to make sure it fits,"The outside is a true medium brown, no red to it.  Nice vintage look.  The interior on mine is black, the usual plush, very well-padded.  The interior dimensions have a little ""give"" to them on account of the padding, but here they are: lower bout = 16"", waist = 12"", upper bout = 13"", headstock area = 6"".  From the lower end of the case to the neck cradle (body length) = 23"".  The depth is 5"", counting the little extra space the domed top provides.  I use mine to keep a vintage Regal Milord guitar in, which is 5"" deep at the endpin, and it fits just fine.  Case is very well made, hinges are high quality, I'm very happy with mine.  One note - I don't believe the hygrometer works.

1112,"I'm thinking about getting the honey burst, but when I looked up this same guitar on sweetwater.com, it looked a lot different. Is the picture right?",The picture is of less quality on amazon.. Sweetwater has a more accurate picture.. On my guitar the dark part around the edge is actually a lot more dark honey in color. and not so much red as in the sweetwater picture. This doesn't mean that the color doesn't vary a bit between guitars.... Mine is beautiful and I get many compliments.. I bought on Amazon.
1113,Does the music sound like the original music or does it sound like someone's synthesizer made it up??,There are no magic microphones that have the original background music. They all use synthesized music.
1114,Hello. What kick pedal would you recomend for this?,You should be able to use any standard  bass drum pedal you like. The kick pad feels pretty good to play on but you're not going to experience the kind of rebound you would with a tensioned drumhead. Felt beaters are OK but I prefer to use a smooth plastic beater. I'd also recommend an adhesive bass drum patch.
1115,"the  picture is confusing, are these permanently angle up or can they be made FLAT without modification? I want my speakers to be level flat.","Yes, they can be made flat as it comes. No modification necessary."
1116,Do you know if it works with a double pedal?,Not recommended. Striking surface is not big enough. Great affordable kit however.
1117,Can you record to an iPad with this mixer via a USB to lightning connector.,I have an iPad 3 and could not get it to work
1118,Any idea what the lowest height setting is?  I'm hoping to get a stand I can use while sitting at my desk.  Thanks!,the lowest height setting of Stage Rocker Powered by Hamilton is 22 inches (56 cm.)
1119,what power supply do you use?,"It largely depends on what type of strips and how many you are going to run. If you check the strips you are going to use you will find that each has a wattage per foot or per strip rating (you can derive one from the other with simple math). If you were only going to run a single 5 meter double density strip of 300 LEDs (these consume 72 watts each) then you can use this supply:Kastar LCD AC Adapter 12V 6A with 3-Prong Power Cord Power Supply for LCD Monitor and LCD TVIf you want to run more strips (I am running 3 double density strips = 216 watts) then you can use this power supply:12v 30a Dc Universal Regulated Switching Power Supply 360w for CCTV, Radio, Computer ProjectThere are other options as well. If you are handy an old PC power supply will do the same trick assuming you know how to wire it as a bench supply. I have some strips running with this arrangement and they work fine.BTW - the listing here is a bit misleading. the unit is rated for 144w yet in the bullets the mfg clearly states it will run 3 strips of 300 LEDs (double density). That's 216 watts. I have several of these and they run three strips with no problem and have been doing so for an extended period of time. Also recall the formula for converting Watts and Amps (this may come in handy if you don't already know it): P=V*I where P=watts, V = volts and I = AmpsYou can use 8 AA batteries as was answered by Heather - however, depending on the setting you use and the strips you connect those batteries will likely be dead in as little as 30 minutes or an hour. 8 AA batteries connected in series will get the correct volts but because of their size they carry only a small reserve of power (amp hours). They are each about 2 Amp Hours (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_battery} therefore with 8 there would be 16 amp hours. Since one strip consumes 6 amps (72 watts / 12 volts) then three strips would consume 18 amps (add another amp for the control unit). At 19 Amps with a battery array that only supplies 16 in an hour your batteries would be drained in about 45 minutes.

1120,"hello, please, this lavalier system comes with the lavalier mic itself?... i do not see it detailed in description...?thank you in advance!","Yes, this product includes a receiver, a wireless transmitter, a microphone, and one lapel clip. I hope that answers your question."
1121,Could I connect this Mbox to my PC via USB the same way I do with my older Mbox? Or can the Mbox only be used via its fire wire port? Thanks.,You have to have fire wire port
1122,"If connected to a ""Behringer Xenyx Q802USB USB Audio Mixer"" will turn on? Or I still need the phantom power to turn on?",Phantom power is needed for it to perform at peak performance.  You can always add a behringer ps400 phantom power supply to your set up and it will take care of the issue.  I think they are about $20 on amazon.
1123,Do you have a echo effect built in?,There are over 20 Early Reflection and Delay (echo) Effects built in. And other combinations of effects that have echo in them.
1124,"What is the difference between the 240, 175 and 165?  Even on the Casio site, there appears to be no significant spec difference between them. Thx!","I was ready to purchase the 165, but before doing so, I downloaded the 40-some page booklet from the Casio site. It covers the LK-160, LK-165 and LK-240. The LK-240 has touch ... like an acoustic piano, you can vary the volume depending how hard you hit the keys. Also, the LK-240 does not have BUT gives the option of purchasing a sustain pedal ($20-30) ... the 165 doesn't have that option. I got the 240, purchased a sustain pedal, and think it's a better deal for really not that much more money. -Jon Strand   P.S. the 175 I know nothing about."
1125,"Do they include an in-line controller/mic for a smartphone? If not, which accesory do I have to buy to do so?",That is not included and not sure where to get that accessory.  But seriously these cans sound amazing!  Don't let that stop you from giving them a try.
1126,My guitar shipped in just the thin retail packaging with no protective outer shipping box.  Anyone else receive theirs like this?,"No, I received mine in an insulated box. It was well protected."
1127,I can hook this up to ipad 3?,"Naw man, I don't think you can, it has a USB cord and unless you can find a apple to female USB cable for iPad and pray that the software supports it (98% sure it doesn't) then no it's just for pc or Mac, they have tons of great ones for the iPad tho, I think Newmark has a real cool one for around 350 400 I think bit it's been a while since I looked at them."
1128,Can this product be used on an acoustic bass as well as an electric bass?,Yes.  I used them on a acoustic bass.
1129,Can I use this with my macbook pro instead of an ipad? The cable it comes with only plugs into an ipad.,Yes. Get a USB cable and it will work with your MacBook Pro
1130,does it come with strings?,"Yes. It's actually a nice package. Comes with the guilele, strings, tuner, two picks and gig bag. Has a nice sound to be so small. I recommend it. Hope this helps."
1131,"One question:  when we play ""Dueling Banjos""... are we supposed to play the banjo or guitar part?  ;D",Yes
1132,What is the duration of the warranty from the manufacturer?  How well does this case hold up beyond the 1st six months?,"I've long since lost my info on the warranty. However, I've traveled to several countries with this case being chucked around with the luggage, mailed it internationally twice, and I've had it for about 2 1/2 years now. Still works perfect and the guitar has never been damaged inside."
1133,What kind of bone is it made of?,"They are ""bone"" color plastic."
1134,"Does this case fit two bows or only one? I am still not clear about that...Also does it have a good suspension, is it safe?","We have had yhis case for about 9 months. My daughter is 13 and really loves it. It is pretty solid, but is fiberglass and can be damaged. Also, it has a place for two bows, but one of them is REALLY tight. Also, there is not much room for extra stuff, like tuner, larger rosin, etc. Your call, but for the orice, was a great buy."
1135,where do you place the snare? upper center front playing surface touching the playing surface?,"Yes, sort of.....the snare attaches to a triangular block of wood which is glued in so that the snare ends touch the front, thin, face, but not right in the center.   That way, there are more variations in sound available at different locations."
1136,Can this amp run safely into 4 Ohm speaker ? Is that 50 watt per/channel into 4 Ohms or 8 Ohms ???,"Dear customer, you're right and I am sorry that I mixed up the model in my last answer. And here's the correct answer: Yes, it's 50w/channel, and totally safe to use with no matter 4ohm or 8ohm speakers."
1137,is this a stand alone keyboard. Can you just plug it into an electric wall outlet?,"I believe that it is and you can, but the keyboard was a gift for my sister and I have never questioned her about it."
1138,Can i use the pedal from my acoustic set for this kit?,Yup.  The kit comes with a pad that is affixed to the bottom of the kit and picks up the bass by having the beater attached to the bass hit against that pad.
1139,"If I have 4 different sections of LED lights not connected together on our boat, will the same remote work for each section? or must use all 4 remotes","One remote will work for all of them.  I have three sets in my kitchen as floor level lights.  Each is separate, but one remote works them all.  I wish they would sell the sensor unit without the additional remotes that aren't needed."
1140,Dose Cubase 7 need USB-ELICENSER??,"Yes you need it plugged in all the time when running cubase 7, but the good news is that this bundle comes with a usb elicencer so you don't need to buy one seperately"
1141,Would this fit a 1/2 size cello?  Thinking of getting it for my daughter.,We have 3/4 size cello. It fits in the stand. Not sure of 1/2 size. It would fit but may have some movement within the stand
1142,"i want to attach this to the bottom of my longboard, do i need to keep the leds plugged in to a power source to keep working?","A power source to run these? Of course not. These run off of Fairy Dust, and luckily they are pre-loaded with a lifetime supply so the lights never turn off. Who needs electricity to run lights?"
1143,so are these very good for studio porpuses??,These are good for studio porpuses. Its fine when me and my friends record
1144,What is the Color Temperature on the K scale?,4100*K
1145,I am wondering if these are bass heavy headphones at all? I listen to ALOT of dubstep and am looking more for a bass heavy headphone!!!,"I am very happy with the level of bass these headphones provide.  It could be that for what you want it may not be enough, however.  Based on all the headphones I have tried, these were the best ones within their price range."
1146,can i connect this mixer to my laptop?,I looked at the mixer and it looks like the usb is only for plugging in mp3 players. You need a audio interface to connect to a laptop I use Roland UA-1G whith my laptop. Sorry for my first response I always just assumed that was what it was for.
1147,also what are those little yellow cords and do they come with the product,"you connect the different modules together, often in interesting ways.  For example...a sine wave oscillator can be used to make a pure tone, OR you can slow it WAY down and use the patch cord to control an audio filter to make an undulating wah-wah tone.   You don't hear the sine wave, you use it to control some other function.  This was Moog's original innovation and is used time and time again in modular synthesizers (and in digital ones, but the connection is less obvious when you're just adjusting parameters on a screen)."
1148,Can the Joyo Power Supply connect to MXR and Fulltone pedals too?,Hi. I have used it with a fulltone but I havent tried it with an mxr but I cant see why not. So far its been great! I use mad professor pedals and it works great with them.
1149,Does the mixer have auxiliary sends for stage monitors?,Yes
1150,since the phe-300 have only TRS inputs and ouputs can I connect my guitar with a ts instrument cable directly into the input 1 TRS ??,"The guitar will be the wrong impedance to work with this device.  It is meant for line-level audio.   You could however, feed an unbalanced (TS) line out from a guitar amp into this device.If you are attempting to isolate hum you suspect is being generated from your axe, before it hits the amp, you will need to address shielding, pickups, and wiring within the guitar itself.  This device is meant to isolate ground loops between line-level audio equipment, such as the output of a DAW to the input of a monitor amp.Good luck!  Hope this helps a little."
1151,Does anyone have the dimensions... specifically the overall length and body length?,"Overall 39 in, Body 18 1/2 inCool guitar, hope this helps"
1152,"Does this come with the adaptors to the fit the iPad Air, or are they STILL a separate purchase. one user (coef&m) received them...have others?",Mine that just arrived did not have the clips and it was advertised on Amazon that they were included
1153,"Can I play this piano and hear the music in my headphones only, thus being able to practice late at night without disturbing the neighbours?",For sure.
1154,Is this tuner suitable for tuning Pianos?  I didn't see any mention of the range it covers.,"I purchased it to use for tuning pianos and am taking a course in piano tuning.  There are stretch tuning settings for vertical and grand pianos in the unit.  I do like the tuner and it works well while you are tuning in the middle of the piano.  It does not pick up the extreme ends on the piano (at least without an accessory microphone), which is not a big deal as you can use tuned notes to reference these notes.  I do really like the strobe on the unit and have found it to work well for me so far.  I was however disappointed to find out that the tuner does not register the measurement of cents of the tone you are playing.  In order to find out how many cents out of tune you are, you need to play the tone on the instrument and then manually match the tone with the tuner.  The bottom line to me is that for the money I feel it is a good buy.  If you have more capital, you might want to look at some of the available software for netbook, tablet or cell phone or look at some of the specific piano tuners.

1157,Will this work with a Blue Yeti mic?,"Auphonix has another pop filter designed for use with the Blue Yeti. It is the same quality pop filter as this one, but will attach more easily to your Yeti, or directly to the desktop. You can find it here: Auphonix 6-inch Pop Filter For Blue Yeti Microphone"

1166,"Recently got this mic.. Getting a lot of hissing noise at all settings, with my canon t3i.. (its connected, green light on). Any settings advice?","I had no problem,  you might want to check that the connector is set correct. You might want to play with the settings off your mic also. I will also do a couple of test settings and if I can duplicate the issue I will let you know."
1167,Could somebody with no recording experience use this product?,Absolutely!
1168,How do people typically affix their logo to the microphone cube?,1st i measured the cube. then i used photo shop to create my logo using the same measurements. when i was happywith the final product i saved it to my USB drive took that to Staples Supplies Store and had them print it out for me
1169,What is the tuning ratio on these?,Another venue says 1:15. I have them on my les Paul w Bigsby. They work great after radical dive bomb s.  My LP tuners are Great. So I bought the inline style for my mixed up jagcaster project. They are tight and precise w no no play. I'm not done with the jagcaster but my LP stays in tune for days and tunes in a hurry. I can actual tune down to note and it will stay in tune for non bigsby bending songs. Hope that helps.

1171,Are there USB and/or MIDI ports?,Yes
1172,What is the shipping package size..one or two boxes ???,"Three boxes.  Two speaker boxes about 30"" X 20"" X 20"", weighing roughly 65 lbs each and the speaker stands in one flat box 42"" X 10"" x 5"". Inspect carefully as my speaker boxes were not handled well by the shipping companies or warehouses somewhere. (The speakers were not damaged except for a bent grill which popped right back out okay. They have worked well for several outdoor concerts since.)"
1173,Is the guitar manufactured in the US correct ?,Yes it is. Made in America. it's a great guitar.  where did you find 1??  i got mine in late Nov. 2013.  thought they were all gone by now.  i think they only made 500.

Amazon and DPS say ""out of stock"", and no response from ChromaCast.","I ordered 2 a year ago and they are not like the original. You will get (per cable) 2 small cable locks and the cable itself. Save time and money-go to a local hardware store, take a piece of you broke cable(to get the right replacement size) and you will be set!"
1175,How well will this work in a gym for a dance?,"This was a gift, along with DJ equipment,, for our grandson. He and his friends love it! They love to dance with it! It follows the beat of the music very well!"

1177,Can this take the place of a looper pedal?,"Yes it can be used as a looper.  But keep in mind it only records for 30 seconds & you can not undo any recordings.  But you can record as many tracks as you like on top of each other.  If you make a mistake you have to start all over again due to no undo function on the unit.  The record quality is very good.  It would be a good starting point for you if you are returning to playing after 42 years.  There are a lot of effect available for you to play with.  The drum machine is very nice to play over as it sounds like real drums, you can even add a bass to your loop then a rhythm guitar then a lead guitar.  You get a lot of bang for your bucks with this unit.  I highly recommend it.....it's hard to find anything close to what it can do for  $50.  I don't know how they can sell it this cheap.  If you find you don't continue playing you are only out $50 so you could resell it.........

The drum machine is very nice to play over as it sounds like real drums, you can even add a bass to your loop then a rhythm guitar then a lead guitar.  You get a lot of bang for your bucks with this unit.  I highly recommend it.....it's hard to find anything close to what it can do for  $50.  I don't know how they can sell it this cheap.  If you find you don't continue playing you are only out $50 so you could resell it.........

1178,Can you use midi files on this keyboard?,"Yes, you can play standard MIDI song files, both format 0 (one MIDI Track chunk) and format 1 (multiple MIDI Track chunks). You can transfer the MIDI file from a computer directly to the keyboard's internal memory using Yamaha's ""Musicsoft Downloader"" software, or load it from a USB thumb drive that's plugged into the keyboard."
1179,Is it a spruce top or a plywood top? It can't be both. Please describe truthfully.,"""SPRUCE TOP"""
1180,does this pedal work on Yamaha P-35 keyboards?,Yes tnks
1181,When Connecting to my M-Audio BX5 D2 speakers to my PC using the XLR to 1/8 stereo RCA Y cable how do i tell which XLR cable goes to which speaker?,"For my cables, the dotted side is the left side, and the solid line is the right side.  In case there is a mismatch and it's the reverse... The quickest way I found out was by taking a song that images (certain sounds in the left and different sounds in the right) one way using headphones, or another source, and playing that through my iPhone.  Once both sources had the same sounds coming from the right and left, I knew I had connected correct cable to each speaker."
1182,does this come with any microphone at all? description doesn't mention.,Yes... I wondered the same thing... It comes w/ a lavalier mic.
1183,What is the difference in this SM57-LC and the SM57?  I can't seem to find what the LC is about.,You can find out here: http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/122/~/can-you-explain-the-difference-between-a-sm57-and-a-sm57-lc-%3F
1184,What is the action like? high and lose or tight against the strings?,"Well its a tad high. I will say that it's a decent instrument for the money. My son (14) has become a pretty good bass player using this guitar. Personally, I think it's a great starter bass for someone who wants to learn the instrument."
1185,Is this only one speaker or is this a pair?,"It's for a pair. I paid $300 for mine a few years ago. Good price here on Amazon but a Google search will show them for even less. Of course, I can't vouch for the integrity of the other sellers."
1186,Can this mic be plugged directly into a mixing board?,No this mic is intended to plug into a wireless transmitter pack that can be worn.
1187,Hi! something about dimensions? Thanks,"The case is about 35.5"" long overall. With the case sitting on its feet (horizontal), the bell end is about 14"" tall. It can also stand on the bell end."
1188,Active or Passive?,It's definitely passive
1189,Is this case sturdy enough for commercial airline travel?,"I really don't think so.  It's kind of like a typical suitcase.  I put my keys on the top of all the other equipment..  The bottom is pretty solid...again, like a typical suitcases bottom/back side.  It is a nice case...but I wouldn't trust any airline with it. (no offense baggage claim...but I've seen your work:)"
1190,Is this the type of device that allows you to plug in a vocal microphone to sing or speak into the AV receiver & out to your surround sound speakers?,Yes. As long as you have an amp to run the speakers.
1191,does this product work with magnepan speakers,"may not be ideal for speakers, but definitely huge improvement when used with subwoofer"
1192,Will this fit an Alvarez DC60-12?,I doubt it.  It didn't fit my Guild.  Had to go with a Fender tweed case.  Best thing to do is measure your guitars length and thickness and only buy a case that has those or larger dimensions.
1193,"I read that the straps are broken easily, my question is, if I take the bag to a sewing thing for the straps would hold a complete set of cymbals?","It made a wonderful Christmas gift. Very pleased!  I imagine if you can find a shoe repair shop they could easily fix it because they use industrial threads and machine....if you can find a shoe repair shop. They do exist, I've had other straps and a buckle taken care of at one. Best of luck"
1194,Does it come with strings or a noter?,"It comes with strings and a noter. Note however that this is a 3/4 sized dulcimer, and while I learned on it, it is better suited to a child than to an adult's hands."
1195,Is the third string wound?,"No, but great strings!!"
1196,"what is the diameter on this tuner? will it fit a 3/8"" hole?",they fit
1197,What is the difference between the EXP16 and the EJ16 strings?  They're both phosphor bronze so wondering.  Thx. : ),"EXPs are Extended Play, meaning they are coated to last longer than normal phosphor non coated bronze. Also a little bit smoother of a tone in my opinion."
1198,"How sturdy is this? Can you lean back on it as if it's an office or folding chair, or will that break something?","Very rugged and very adjustable{upand down,in and out} I bought this to reto fit it onto a nice pneumatic stool with a footrest that I play guitar on .  Simply screwed the bracket into the bottom of the stool and screwed 2  2hole electrical pipe clamps over the bracket, on on each side of the adjuster knob. very sturdy and can be removed out of the bracket in 2 seconds for transporting to gigs. Really don't like sitting on drum thrones to play guitar. Too low, no footrest."
1199,Is the finish matte or polished?,It has a beautiful matte finish.
1200,how loud is this drum? is it suitable for apartment living?,The closest thing I can say its as loud as maybe tapping in a Pringles potato chip container with pens. I think you should be ok for apartment living. I'm moving into a condo next year and I am still going to play on it.

1203,What are the diamensions of the case? I was wondering if it will fit the Schylling Musical Hand Bells.,"Something about 40cm X 15cm. I think Schylling Musical Hand bells should fit there in too. But note that it's not a hard case, it's material only and very soft."
1204,What are the dimensions of this item?,"6in diameter, 1.5in side"
1205,Will this fit a kids lap harp?  Thanks,The tuner fits square shaped knobs on most autoharps and lap harps.  I believe if you can go to the tuning hammer website it will give you dimensions.

1207,How long is the electrical cord?,It's short not longer than 4 feet
1208,In this description it does not state what size it is?    Does anybody know what size this is??,"Yes, it fits the sound hole on a standard body, dreadnaught, and jumbo size from most makers.  If it doesn't fit tightly but covers the sound hole, it will still help. If it is a little bigger than the sound hole you can slid one of the tabs in and either trim the other tab or let it sit on top of the face. Even without a perfect fit it is better to keep the right humidity level inside the body than let the body dry out."
1209,are you suppsed to take the pick guard off of this mandolin,"No, I would never take the pick guard off of this mandolin. Without it, picking would wear through the wood. I still play this mandolin untill this day, and I actually never have problems with it. I was being critical when I said it buzzes when I strum hard."
1210,Would this work for a Squier by Fender Affinity P/J Bass Guitar? or should I get the wide bodied one?,"yes, this would work.  it is very adjustable and works wonderfully!"
1211,What is the thread size on this part. the white tip model for Fender Squier is too big (6mm?). Mine is a 1989 USA Squier - anyone know what will fit?,I'm not sure the exact size. I bought this for a 96 US Made Fender Lone-Star Strat and it fit perfectly.
1212,Will this case fit a fender starcaster?,"My fender electric acustic guitar fits into my case like a glove but the body on my guitar is a lot thicker and wider then yours but from what I can tell it looks like yours should fit, good luck."
1213,Can I connect it directly with a camera that has XLR input? Or do I need to go through some sort of transmitter first?,You can plug directly into a camera with an XLR input. The mic's power is supplied by the batteries in the unit.
1214,"what version should i get to mod this headphones: the closed, semi open damped, or just the semi open?","The T50RP model is the one you want, which should be listed as ""RP-Series Damped Semi-Open Headphones.""  It is the only one with brass-colored adjustment bars on either side."
1215,Grado carts don't work w/ rega tables It hums But is there a way to MAKE it work?Can the ground be isolated signal cable or made to work any othr way?,I grounded my turntable to the pre amp. Look. At the back of the pre amp for a ground bolt
1216,Does this clip rotate?,Yes
1217,"How would this do with a violin, a really good, and rather expensive violin that will be played mostly acoustically, only occasionally plugged in?","Wendy,I am a guitar player, but a friend of mine that plays violin professionally at Disneyland tried the AKG 411 and said that it was too midrangy for his tastes. He prefers a lavalier mic he paid $25 for at Radio Shack. He places the mic behind the bridge. He plays live with it and has no feedback problems. I have heard it and it sounds great. He said he prefers this mic over the expensive mics he has tried.D"
1218,Does free shipping apply to Australia? I would like to purchase a new Bach 180S37 Stradivarius trumpet.,"Sorry i don't ship over seas you would have to contact the store.Thanks, Mike Jones1-815-363-5900"
1219,one review says the cymbals don't touch? is this really the case? or was his set incorrectly adjusted?thanks,"I bought the set for my husband. He said that they do touch. The will need to be adjusted correctly, if they are not touching. He adjusted them after the purchase."
1220,"I am sound system illiterate; however, I would like to know can each mic go into a different slot on our sound board. I know that is better for mixing","Yes it can, the devise has 4 individual 1/4 outputs or one xlr leveled output.  Individual mic controls are much better for leveling out your sound board, especially if you are having issues with squelch or clipping."
1221,"i want to put it underneath the sub-woofer to damp it's horrible vibrations to the floor, will it work?",I would suggest speaker spikes for that application
1222,can this work through iphone?,Yes. I just tried it on my iPhone5 voice memo. Wouldn't have thought of it if you hadn't asked. Obviously I disagree with Ben.
1223,"I know nothing about guitars, and want to get this as a gift. If i were to purchase this, what all comes with it,& do I need to buy anything else 4 it","If you already have an amp, you'll need a 9V battery and possibly another guitar cable.  Hope this helps-not a bad distortion pedal for the money."
1224,What guitars will this strap work on? Would like to order the guitar for dummies but it  doesn't  come with a strap,It should work with any guitar that has strap studs.  These are the little chrome knobs at the bottom and usually the top of the guitar body.You must have 2 studs to use this strap.

1228,Do you think this will be enough power for my two 15 inch speakers and my two 12 inch subs?,Yes
1229,Can you check intonation.For example:  High E OPEN then at the twelfth fret?,"Yes you can. If the 12th fret is sharp then turn the screw to the right. If flat, turn left until it in perfect tuning or close to it. I use a Babicz's bridge and Gotoh head stock tuners. This improves the tuning and intonation quite a bit. It's very easy to check the intonation with a Babicz's bridge. It has cams instead of set screws and a string saddle.Hope this helped!"
1230,Can this polish be used to clean the fret board?,"hi sam, lemon oil is the way to go. scott Also music nomad guitar polish works well for the rest of the guitar."
1231,"Hi, Will I be able to connect an android phone to the system? And can I control the songs/volume from my phone or does it have to be docked?  Thanks","Yes, you can connect any device to the system... it has an adapter cable that fits 1/4 inch or 3.5 mm plugs. As to having to be docked in order to control the volumes and track selections... you are able to adjusted volumes which ever way you prefer (the device or the system), however your track selections must be controlled from the device."

1234,I filled the tank and turned it on. Within 5 minutes the tank was empty. Is this normal?,"This version is not the Froggy's Fog Snow Machine - The Pictures, Description and Manufacturer are wrong.  This machine is a toy version by Forum Novelties.  1 tank should last about 20 minutes.  I am not sure why yours would be using the entire tank in 5 minutes.  Please call us at 877-376-4499 x 4 for technical service and one of our team will be happy to work with you on the solution."
1235,What of the tone of this metronome ?,"It makes a ticking noise, and you can set it to 2, 3, 4, or 6/4 times, where a high pitched bell (ding) rings on the downbeat."
1236,is it a good guitar for a 10 yr old beginner?,"Frank,  It is absolutely a good guitar for a 10 years old with this price.  When I bought this guitar, my son was also 10 years old.  This guitar was recommended by his guitar's instructor when my son started the lesson.Hope that your boy/girl would enjoy it."
1237,"Does it work to record on pc without using the normal amplifier (A peavey 7w, too static noise for record)",No. I'm not sure what you have in mind but this is strictly a booster designed to raise the signal of a guitar or keyboard before going into an amp. It is not suitable for use in any recording chain.
1238,"What is the interior length? My 12-string acoustic is 43"" long.","The inside length is 43 1/8 inches; upper bout is 13 inches; and lower bout is 16 1/2 inches. Depth is 5 inches (with lid closed). Since your guitar is 43 inches long, it should fit. My Oscar Schmidt 12-string is 43 inches long."
1239,"I'm a new guitarist, hope you'll pardon my ignorance, but would I need an M-Audio/ sim device to rec to my computer, with this item, Thanks,","Hello Dano686, well my friend this equipment gives you the oportunitty to modify the sounds of your guitar like you were playing through a series of the best amplifiers of the world. Only one of the modeled fender amplifiers cost a fortune. In order to record you will need another device where you can plug the outline of the FloorPOD Plus. I have a Lexicon Alpha that I plugged to my computer and I mixed my recordings with Ardour (the best free software for recording and mixing) under Debian Linux Operating System. You can also use any other software of your choice. I highly recommend you to purchase the FloorPod Plus, or some of the new products of Line6, they're really good. I hope I helped you. My best regards from Venezuela.

1240,Does it have to be hooked up  to anything or can my kids use it to sing along with the radio,"It needs to be hooked up to an amplifier, usually a PA system, that drives loudspeakers."
1241,Will a Modern Players Fender Jaguar fit in this case?,"In my experience, my jazzmaster won't fit. I think a jaguar would have the same problem."
1242,What is the actual size of the xylophone?,"It is 12 inches wide (that includes some plastic on either end) and the longest bar is 4"".  It is smaller than I anticipated, but has a fine sound."
1243,Use on a laptop?,Couldn't tell ya mine was as broken when I received it. Not due to shipping.
1244,What is the difference between the AKGD5 and the AKGD5S?,"Hello! The AKG D5S has an on/off switch, while the D5 does not. (So ""S"" = ""switch"".) Having recently used my D5S at a solo performance, I was very glad to have the on/off switch right in front of me! If you are considering either of these mics, I would suggest the S model for that very reason. By the way, this is one terrific microphone! I had always used Shure mics in the past but went with this AKG model after reading a lot of reviews. The sound is excellent."
1245,did the cables come with thes set up,"Everything to set up light itself comes in kit.  But, mic. cable did not to daisy chain.."
1246,"Will this work as an expression pedal with the Line 6 M13? Is a ""volume pedal"" the same thing as an ""expression pedal""?",A volume pedal is usually one that you insert in line with your AUDIO signal to allow volume changes. Those have two jacks so you can put them into the signal path. An Expression pedal usally means that it has a single 1/4 plug on the end which is meant to go into the 'control voltage' jack of a keyboard (as opposed to a sustain pedal plug attached which goes into the jack of the keyboard or controller). That will allow you to control more than just volume depending how your keyboard allows you to assign that jack. But the point is - you need a 'control' input for this pedal.
1247,"is there a way to record or play live, like a line out or something of that nature? or is there just a headphone out?","Its a headphone/output jack. I've put this into a PA system and played with it in a jam session. It holds up fine, but don't expect multiple outputs for each trigger. If you run it through a VST like BFD or something, then you can control each trigger and do eq on them."
1248,Is it made of latex?,GelRest says the product is made of vinyl.
1249,"How can this be a ""1/2"" size guitar at 34"" long?   The full-size version is 38"".  Not much of  a size difference.  So ???",I don't think guitar size actually means the length of the entire guitar but rather the guitar scale length (measure from bridge to nut of the guitar). If it measures about 20.5 in. then it qualifies as a 1/2 size guitar. Hope that helps : )
1250,What's the string gage size that comes with this guitar?,It comes with regular slinkys but I recommend changing to super slinkys. Lighter gauge for faster shredding.
1251,Do you prefer the kaossiltor 1 over the kaossilator 2?,"i have the koass 1 (seen to your left) and the kpro. i don't own the kaoss 2. but based on vids on youtube, 2 is easier to use."

1253,where is it made,All of the parts of this guitar are made in USA. The assembly takes place in Mexico.This is a wonderful guitar. You'll love it!
1254,is the Vic Firth logo or any text on the stick?,"Yes, the logo is painted in black on every stick"
1255,Would B.C.Rich Warbeast guitar fit inside ? and what's the actual color inside? I prefer purple,"No it won't. I bought this case for a BC Rich Warlock and it is WAAAAAY to small. The only thing that actually fit in this case was my Fender Squire, and it a tight fit to say the lest. Good Luck contacting the company to find one that will fit, the phone number just rings and they don't return e-mails. I ended up getting a used one on e-bay since BC Rich and coffin case severed ties a few years back. And in case you still care the interior is red."
1256,Does this work with OSX Mavericks via Thunderbolt?,"Yes, you'll just need a firewire to thunderbolt adaptor"
1257,is playing this easy if you can play guitar?,"Yes. It's tuned like the four treble guitar strings, or like a ukulele, so chording is similar. Frets are a little small for my Big Hammy Fingers, though ;-)"
1258,Does it come  With Guitar strap,Yes
1259,"Standard equiptment is 19in"" from side to side, so how will my pieces fit when this rack states rails at 20"" apart?  Is this a misprint?",Yes it is a misprint -- I have the case and all equipment fit like it was suppose to. I think they are referring to the cases total width and not necessarily the rack.
1260,does anyone that owns this case use it on a firebird with mandolin tuners?,"yes it can. i use it with mine, which has banjo tuners. great case."
1261,Does this work in FL Studio?,"This should work with any DAW application, you would just need to install drivers and configure in preferences in your specific DAW."
1262,I asked earlier about the case smelling bad.  I should have included that the case my flute came in is the soft one.  Smell???????,We haven't experienced that and my son has had his for more than 18 mos.
1263,Are There Strap Brackets on It?,There are no strap brackets or anything to attach a strap to the banjo.
1264,What is the diameter and length of the stem on these casters?  I have a bass amp with caster sockets already installed.,1 1/2 Inches long and 3/8 diameter.
1265,Do you need a amp with this unit?,Nah.
1266,will this case fit my s 12?,"Yes, the S12 will fit."
1267,windows,Works great with freestyler dmx on windows. Also has drivers for other various programs that run on windows.
1268,Size?? How long is the cello?,It is approximately two inches in length from neck to pin (without pin extended).
1269,Would this be good for Karaoke (I have a Karaoke Mixer) or for connecting to a Projector to boost the sound?,I don't think so. This is an amp for ELECTRIC GUITAR.
1270,Is it quality,much quality     wow kalasuch aquila
1271,We are really really interested in this mixer .. can you tell me why it is still available after over a year?,"Hi Justin,Sorry for the confusion.  Yes, we have this mixer instock ready to ship.Thanks again for your interest in our itemsDon"
1272,How many pedals can fit in this case? Could a volume pedal fit too? How do the pedals get their power?,"I fit 16 pedals of varying sizes, including a Dunlap Wah and an Ernie Ball volume pedal. Voodoo Labs pedal Power 2, Daisy chained. Be forewarned though- fully decked out and in the case, this weighs as much as a big amp! Worth it though!"
1273,Does the Godin A6 Ultra come with a gig bag case?,Yes. It comes with a godin bag with great pockets and a good amount of padding.
1274,Can this be plugged into another receiver so the speakers throughout the building can be used?,Yes just use the 1/4 inch mic output or the two pro mic outputs
1275,where is it manufactured? Not China I hope.,No not china
1276,is the shock mount made of plastic? or steel or what?,steel.
1277,And it came with the gig bag?,Yea it did
1278,Can this be assembled without the Mic holders?,"Yes, it can be assembled without the mic holders.  There are only 2 screws that secures each mic holder so they are easily installed or uninstalled."
1279,Is it good for travelling by plane?,"Yes, this is the next-best thing to those bulky professional road cases used by touring musicians.  I've accidentally backed a vehicle over a case like this, with no damage to the guitar inside (though I wouldn't recommend testing that out on purpose)."
1280,"Could this case fit my Schecter Omen FT Active (6 String)? It's this guitar Schecter Omen FR Active 6-String Electric Guitar, Satin Black",No it wouldn't. The SGR-2A is designed to fit a guitar with and avenger body like The Syn model or the Dale Stewart avenger bass. For an omen you would want the SGR-1C case. Schecter also makes a universal case but it doesn't form fit the guitar where as the 1C would fit your omen :)
1281,"What is the difference in sizes between 1/4 1/2 and 4/4 Am thinking of getting one, just not sure about the size.",depends the player age. 1/4 2/4 3/4 4/4 means the size or length of the violin. 1/4 is for 5-8 years. 4/4 is for adult. 2/4 3/4 is for age between them.
1282,Will this stand work with a banjo?,The stand holds a guitar perfectly. If the banjo is the same as a guitar it should fit.
1283,Guitar---Amp--- 1/4in Cable----This Product-----1/4inch cable----- Recording Interface. Will this work or do i need a special cord for the output?,"I have this and it's a noisy piece of junk,spend a little more for a quality one."
1284,Does this guitar have knobs/pegs where you can put a strap?,No it doesnt ! But sounded pretty good for entry level !
1285,does this fit with any kind of takamine g series guitar?,"It is supposed to. But I can speak from experience, if you have a NEX body type G Series, it will not fit snug (the shape is not right)."
1286,What are the dimensions? Side-to-side? Height? and front-to-back?,"H-1 3/4""W-4""L-17"" without rack mountL-18"" with rack mount"
1287,"Needles, Sound Quality? Any information on those parts of the ION turntable?","I bought this TT (not from Amazon) and am very unhappy with the sound quality.  All those 5-star reviewers must have very forgiving ears or none at all!  This thing changes the volume as it plays, it misses some frequencies, and although unnoticed by most, the rotation speed is also unstable leading to notes going out of tune. A lot of its problems are due to the cheap stylus used. Not sure if replacing it with a better needle is the solution since this unit has many other design flaws. Unless you only listen to ""bang-bang"" rock music on low-bitrate MP3s and never bother with classical music, this device may work for you.  The software issues are irrelevant.

1291,Does this work with an Android device like tablets and smartphones. I will be using it with the Dragon software.,"Since this is a normal microphone with built-in noise cancellation capability, it should work perfectly on other devices including Android tablets and smartphones, as long as you have a 3.5 mm plug adapter (see the review)."
1292,"What are the dimensions of the stand when completely folded up, specifically its length?  What are the bag's dimensions?","Don't have it here with me, but maybe 30"", give or take..."
1293,can these lights be used without the sound activation or color chasing programs?  I'm looking for a light to just shine constant color.  Is this the one????,It can.  There are different settings one of them being 'user' where you can set it to be a wash of color in the RGB spectrum.
1294,Does this tuner work on oboes,"Really well, I am an oboe player and bought it for tuning up orchestras and tuning my oboe when I'm playing. It works really well, has a long-lasting battery and is accurate."
1295,can these be attached to 12v battery,Yes.  They run from 12v dc so a battery would work fine.  Run-time will be determined by your battery size/capacity... you would need a battery of sufficient size if you plan to run these very long or if you want to run multiple strips (think motorcycle or car battery).
1296,Can you us lots of different effects at the same time??,"Within limits.  For example, to an exising pre-set effect you can adjust reverb (with a variety of reverb settings), or modulation (like chorus or flanger with a range of settings) but you can't do both reverb and modulation."
1297,Is it compatible with korg sp100?,Yes
1298,will this guitar take 10-46 strings? What size strings come on this guitar?,"I believe this guitar comes standard with 10-46.  If it doesn't, it will definitely work well with them.   The biggest trick with the modified bridge is that the route isn't far enough back on the body to slip the new strings in without basically raising the bridge all the way up, then down again once all the strings have been inserted."
1299,does it come with an A/C adaptor?,"Yes, it does. At least when I purchased mine last year it did."
1300,Is this controller compatible with Mainstage3?,It sure is. It's what I use it with and every button immediately recognizes and controls all the functions.
1301,What size is the nut?,"2"""
1302,Can ypou assign your own music to be sampled?,"The software CD that comes with the new MPD26 contains a free, limited version of Ableton Live. You can use that software to manage sampling and triggering your own samples, I have. I do find the free version pretty limiting, and if you want to do serious sampling you'll want to upgrade to a paid version of Ableton or use some other software."
1303,This Pedal includes power supply?,"no, it is not included. it use the Boss PSA, you must buy separately"
1304,Is it loud enough to play with an acoustic group in a moderate sized church?,I would think so yes :)
1305,Can you tell me the width and length?  Thanks.,"It is 20.5"" wide and 54"" long."
1306,"Does this pedal work well/sound good with other analog pedals? I was considering getting this pedal, using it just for reverb at times.","Works very well, very solid pedal, I downloaded eftp patches from Charlie Hall, worked great enjoy"
1307,How does this artist react to fingerstyle playing,"I am not good at finger picking, but my instructor tried it and was impressed.  I can tell with the slightly larger string spacing, you will get a cleaner sound fingerpicking.  Again, the tone from this cedar-mahogany combination is warm and beautiful."
1308,Does this product interface with Halogen lights? I have the Chauvet Stagewash 900 with dip switch (not digital) addressing.,"This product is only useable with led lights that use dmx addressing, I hope this helps."
1309,how do I transfer dialog(an old radio show)  The cd I burned only plays in my pc--not cd player.,"If CD u burned is in mp3,  reburn to wav on CD, if ur CD player doent play mp3, u need to burn as wav like other CD music CD's, make shure ur CD player can play CD-r's, older CD players don't reconize CD-r"
1310,would this set be good for a 14 year old boy,"Yes. Plus, it has headphone socket, so it's good for 14 year old boy's parents too!"
1311,"My left PMO.4n unit developed woofer distortion with low bass tones. Is this repairable ? They are used for video editing, not loud music. Thanks !","I don't know what is particularly wrong with your left speaker. I can just admit, that the cheep Fostex PM0.4n has no protection against overloading, as for example the expensive Genelec has...Sometime, I wish to play my Fostex PM0.4n louder, but I can't. They start clipping making noticeable clicking sound."
1312,Do I need to purchase an amp for it,"Hello. To answer your question, no, not necessarily. It depends on your purpose of use for it. I use it to record songs onto my laptop, therefore I do not need an amp for it. I just plug in the micrphone cable to the mic outlet on the laptop. If you are using for other purposes like performing on stage, i would recommend that you use an amp for it. Hope I helped! :)"
1313,Can I use two mics similtaneously?  I ordered one and the mic input on the right is not working.  Just wondering if product is defective?,"The unit support 2 input and 2 output, which are separate. Check that you are in fact not turning the knob to direct the audio to USB.Also check that your levels are correct, in the VU meter on the device; both should light up when you send signals to both channels. Also check that your gain and your like selector is in the correct position."
1314,Is this model really any better than the smaller and simpler Solo XT model which gets a higher Amazon rating? What's added here?,"I use the JML2 as a sample player exclusively.  I do no looping.  I am a singer/guitar player who uses the unit to start and stop backing tracks with my foot.  Left = click  ~  Right = tracks.  Aside from the archaic procedures and limitations to maneuver the software when loading audio into the unit; (it cannot be read as an external drive without the quirky ""JamManager"" software which is cumbersome), it is a solid unit.  I needed stereo so I can only say it's better than the Solo XT due to that fact."
1315,Is this set exactly as pictured with both sets of cymbals on stands?  I've seen other Gammon sets where one is attached to the top of the bass drum.,One is attached to the base drum
1316,Is there storage in the bench?,No
1317,What's a good 9 volt adapter to buy for this unit?,Hi. Well I use this pedal with the Joyo Power Supply 2. No problems.
1318,Curious if these would work to keep noise from a neighbors bass out?,"NIKKI, these will help limit the bass from bouncing around your unit but it won't keep the sound out of your unit. For that, you need some serious insulation in the ceiling or walls you share. To really limit how much bass you hear from an adjoining unit is very hard without spending a lot of $$$ , as the low frequencies cause vibration in the structural framing, which tends to amplify the bass vibrations. That's why you also feel the bass in your floor and walls, not just hear it.Insulation will help but it won't eliminate it. Might be cheaper to buy noise canceling headphones or pay for music lessons so the quality of the bass playing improves! Reminds me of ""Neighbors"" by the Rolling Stones! Good luck!

1319,"In the description it says ""110 Volt Switchable Power Supply""....does this mean the power can be switched from 110v. to 220v/240v?",Available 110-120 or 220-240v ac 50/60 hz so yes
1320,Is the bag upright when you put it on the floor or does it sit at an angle?,"it depends how heavy the stuff in it is.  i keep a laptop, charger, usb interface, cables, sustain pedal and some small stuff, mine's leans forward a tad if i set it on the base."
1321,There are 2 footswitch jacks in the back of my Delta Blues 115. One for channel and one for reverb/tremolo. How many switches do I need if this switch,"I only know that this footswitch works on amps with one footswitch jack.  I use this footswitch on an older model Studio Pro, like this model, http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/331131901560?lpid=82  Check out pictures..."
1322,"Why is the USB socket on top, does it get in the way?",I am not sure why it's there.  That's the manufacturer.  Never has gotten in my way.  Great mixer.
1323,"What is the length on this reel? what is the length on the reel of RGB Color Changing Magic LED Strip waterproof LED With Controller and Power Supply, 2054RGB",The video review says 16 feet I think
1324,thinking of bringing this as a gift to a friend in Italy. He plays electric guitars and has an ipad. Would the plugs on guitars in Italy be the same?,"From my knowledge they should be the same, but I'm not sure. It's a normal guitar reviewer and then headphone jack plug in."
1325,I have fat fingers so I need a decent sized Nut Width. Can anyone tell me how big it is?,"Hello, I just measured it because I was not sure, it's 1 5/8"" at the nut and highest (20th) fret width is 2 1/4. I kind of have fat fingers too and this thing has a great feel, spacious between frets and has great action. Hope that helps."
1326,How easy is it to put together?,Very easy to assemble!
1327,"Does the SMH-A0302 clamp kit work on its own, or do you have to have the SMH10 system with it?","Yes , you have to have the SM10 unit to snap on to it. Great if you have two or more helmets so you can switch between them."
1328,"Another question: Is the case tall/wide enough to put LPs in it while still in their jackets, or do the jackets have to be removed for the LPs to fit?",LPs will fit inside their jackets. There is plenty of room.
1329,How can I control computer volume through this mixer!,"Let me give you an overview of how this works:This mixer is not a ""soundcard"" type device, rather it is a simple mixer that will hook up to your computer using the digital USB port.It allows for external sources (music players, microphones, guitars, etc.) to be routed to your computer's USB port as a STEREO ONLY (left & right audio channels) input device. Using USB for an input will give you a cleaner audio signal that using old analog cables (RCA, 1/4"", etc.)This mixer is not controlled by the computer, but there are audio parameters that you can adjust on your PC computer.If you go to START>CONTROL PANEL>SOUND there you can find the global audio settings for the computer. After installation you ""may"" find some additional settings such as Overall Volume, Left or Right Panning, Input Levels and Output Levels as well as what devices are available.This mixer is not a multi-track recording mixer/soundcard, but you can record up to 2 independent channels (left and right) at once, and using recording software such as Cakewalk, Magix Music, Adobe, etc. you can build up a recording using two tracks at a time.This is a great little mixer to start with for uses that do not require advanced audio engineering demands.

1330,Includes the clamps? If not what kind of clamps it needs?,U need buy clamps separe and depend what ligths do u have
1331,My daughter got this for Christmas didn't realize I had to get an adapter. I ordered that and everything on the computer says its working but its not,We had to return the one I got my son for Christmas. After we purchased the microphone I went out to get the adapter to USB. The computer said it was working but it never received audio input. I think it has to go directly into an amp. It seems like a great mic but doesn't fit our use. I replaced it with a snowball. Half the price and works great.
1332,is it battery operated or is it electric?,"It's electric.  The cord is about 4-4-1/2' long, three-prong.  I don't see that there's a possibility for this amplifier to be electric."
1333,Will this make me be able to play exactly like Neil Peart?  Or do I have to spend more on a better kit?,"Yes, this drum kit will make you better than Neil Peart. This kit is one thousand times better than any kit on the market. Beware however; if you want to play as good as Keith Moon, you must drink several bottles of booze and consume mass quantities of pills."
1334,what frequency does it broadcast on?,It is not 487 to 507 MHz.    Band D - 656.125 to 678.500 MHz
1335,can they be used on an iPad Air tablet?,"oh yes men, it works on everything. and the quality is great according to other overprice headphones that the bass is only distortion. im glad i could help. and enjoy your new headphones."
1336,my 13 year old is learning at school.....is this good for her to practice with? I dont want to spend alot until I know shes gonna like it for a while,It should be fine for her as it is quite small and sounds good for beginners! It will take some effort to tune it at the beginning though.
1337,Thanks for your answer. I would like to double confirm if there are included accessories that mentioned on website....,Hello Yes from 8thstreet Music. Thanks!
1338,Does the cymbal come with a cable?,Yup. Comes with a cable and the hardware to hook it up to a cymbal stand
1339,What is the depth of the case?Judith D.,"The internal depth is 10 cm or about 4 inches.  I opened it up and stuck a ruler in there.  Externally, it's 11.8 cm or about 4.6 inches with the case lid closed."
1340,Is it sturdy enough and is the angle comfortable for typing?,It is very sturdy.  I have even moved the table it was on while DJing with little to no sway.  As for comfort it depends on the table you are setting it on.  The angle it holds it at would put the keyboard of most laptops at an angle similar to a normal desktop keyboard propped up on it's back risers.  I think it's fine.
1341,Can use both mic's at the same time ?,Yes as long as you programmed each mic on two different frequencies
1342,Is this guitar for a beginner?,"This is an excellent guitar all the way around; the price is right on, and the quality of sound will amaze you; don't hesitate to buy, at this price its quite worthy...! I bought one for my daughter and she loves it; I have an acoustic Epiphone costing twice as much, and the Fener CD-60 is right there with it... Great buy!  Thx. Hollywood'n AZ."
1343,Is there a way to save a sequencer song to the SD card that includes a built-in rhythm on A tracks of others on B tracks?,Thanks anyway.  My question had a typo in it.  Is there a way to save a sequencer song to the SD card that includes a built-in rhythm on the A (System) tracks AND others on the B tracks?
1344,Do I need an amplifier to play it?  Can I use headphones with it?  Do I need any extra cords?  Thanks,"If you want it to be loud, then yes, you'll need an amp.  It doesn't come with an amp cord.  If you want to use headphones with it, you'll need something like this Vox headphone amp:Vox amPlug Metal Guitar Headphone AmpAlso, a word of advice:  Make sure that the nuts that secure the knobs to the body are tight, otherwise you might find that the pots rotate out of position and the contacts touch the wall of the hole that they're mounted in.  This will cause your guitar to stop making cool noises (or noises of any kind, for that matter).

1346,cymbals are included,"No only drums..,"
1347,Does this work with Logic Pro X and ProTools 11?,"I've used it successfully with both.  For Protools it took these extra Steps below.1. Install latest USB midi driver from http://korg.com/nanoseries22. Hold down set marker and play while plugging USB cable into NanoKontrol2 from your computer.3. In Pro Tools, click on setup and go to peripherals.4. Open the midi controllers tab in peripherals.5. Select ""HUI"" as type, NanoKotrol (slider/konb) for send to, and NanoKotrol (CNTRL) as the receive from port."
1348,Does this work on Windows 8?,Yup!!!
1349,Can you hook this up to a laptop instead of an ipad?,"Yes, it has a USB interface."
1350,So Can this be used with PC & Mac as well - as interface/mixer,No
1351,Will it hold guitars that are in cases?,"All of the hold points in the hardware are movable, so you could certainly put guitars in cases on there (by moving the hold points or removing them), but I would expect that you could not get a full five guitars on unless the cases are quite thin.  Right now I have 2 acoustics and 3 electrics on mine (not in cases -- one of the acoustics is concert-size, the other is a thinner Ovation), and they all fit with a bit of room to spare.  In fact, I ordered another set of the hold points so that if I am placing only electrics on there, I could get 6 on."
1352,"Hi, I just bought the prs se custom 24 electric guitar vintage sunburst today!  Wondering if this case is a good fit for it.  Thank you in advance!","This should help you see if it would fit:Interior Dimensions    Body Length: 18.00 ""    Body Height: 3.25 ""    Lower Bout Width: 13.00 ""    Middle Bout Width: 13.00 ""    Upper Bout Width: 13.00 ""    Overall Length: 36.50 ""- See more at: http://www.gatorcases.com/p/16136-768/gwe-elec-wide#sthash.rXgN1Juo.dpuf"
1353,"How close do you have to have the mic in order for it to get good volume?  Can I sit back a bit, or do I have to be right on top of it?","I'm no expert but, any good mic requires you to be fairly close unless you are looking at using a shotgun mic. With this mic, I suggest you be about a fist length away. This is an extremely good mic, it compares to my Heil PR 40 which cost me about $340."
1354,"I want to control a small 12 volt RGB LED display, specifically, I want to fade VERY slowly from one color to another.  Will this unit do that?",This unit has many limitations.  I tried it out but returned it to purchase the Chauvet Obey 10. It is more expensive but is more versatile.  You can easily fade colors manually but automatic fading will be a function of the available programs of your specific RGB unit.  I purchased a pair of American DJ Profile Panels which have a slow multicolor fade program on board.  One fader on the Chauvet Obey 10 is used to select that program and another fader is used to select the speed of the fade.
1355,"Are the prongs adjustable? If not, would they hold a mandolin, ukelele, and banjo along with guitars?",Not really adjustable. Holder threads into wall mount. Should hold all of those no problem just make sure you get longer screws to mount base.
1356,I bought this to use for a Canon T3i DSLR and the audio is 1 speaker only. My dual mono adapter I used on my other lapel mic doesn't work with this?,Are you plugging this straight into the camera?.. or into a transmitter?
1357,"what are the internal dimensions? i have a sound module with a depth of 18 1/8"" that i hope to mount on the 6u portion",Yes it will work!
1358,Does the case have a hook for locking the case with a padlock?,No it does not.
1359,Can this mount on the Rode Micro Boom Pole Telescopic Microphone Extension?,Yes
1360,How does this connect to a Mac?  It appears that all the connections are to an iOS device.  What cable is needed to connect to a MacBook Pro?,Box contains cable for Connect to mac.
1361,Do you have rigid case for it avaliable ?,I have a soft gig bag
1362,"is this a tenor, bari, supr?",It is a concert ukulele. I also had a hard time figuring it out. My musical experts pronounced it a Concert Uke as soon as they saw it. It will need better quality strings & also you will need to purchase an amplifier if you want to electronically increase the volume for groups or fun or performing. It does not come w/ an amp - but has the capability to be acoustic or electric. I really like this uke !
1363,Are the dimensions correct? 47x5.2x19.8...seems large for a 3/4 size guitar.,"It it smaller than a ""regular"" guitar, at first I thought I had ordered a regular size version guitar, I just wanted acoustic with nylon strings and it being a Fender is a Plus.  When I recieved it I love the size, it's alot smaller than you think but sitting it is so easy to play and for a child it is the perfect learning size.  but I'm an adult and love the size.  Honestly, I did not know they can in this smaller size..  I love it!!"
1364,How long is the guitar in inches?,Just about 38 inches.
1365,does it weight 15O pounds??,"The instrument and the accessories do not weigh 150 lbs. i would say arond 15-20, and i would say it is because of the packaging. The case is sturdy and lightweight. You can carry it like a backpack. I think this is a good instrument."
1366,Receiver - Control Center WORK WITH BATTERY  OR ELECTRICAL? IF ITS WORK IN ELECTRICAL WHAT IS THE VOLTAGE 110 OR 240 ?,110 my friend wonderful set up works great for a church.
1367,"I thought this had an AC power adapter so you didn't have to run on batteries.  Is that true, or just  batteries?","Good question! I just took the batteries out of my H2n, and connected a standard 5v charger to the USB port and YES, it ran normally in this mode. It did ask me to set the date/time, and I expect it would do this every time I plugged it in."
1368,Can these produce a reasonably good white light?,"Yes the white light is good on the subject, it lights all the LEDs at the same time to produce the white and it is pretty strong at the end of the beam. However the LEDs don't turn white on the actual fixture. Minor details though if no one is looking at the par itself. Plus it's blinding bright when you look right into it"
1369,Where is this uke made?,"Oscar Schmidt Ukes are made in Indonesia but set up here in the U.S. They are made there because of the access to many wood farms in that country. Oscar Schmidt and Washburn are owned by U.S. Music Corporation out of Mundelein, Il"
1370,Is the fretboard wide on this model for easy fingering?  It's for a beginner.,"Nop, it's thin like an electric guitar. But for the price it sounds pretty good."
1371,What are the internal dimensions of the basket?,Stainless tank has rounded corners and tapers to smaller at the bottom. Longer dimension: 7 1/4 inches at top going down to 6 1/2 inches at bottom. Shorter dimension: 6 1/4 inches at top going down to 5 1/2 inches at bottom. Measurements approximate but within 1/8 inch or so.
1372,What are the uses you have given to this item? And how is the built and performance quality?,"I use the amplifier in the classroom daily and the product is made of good quality, easy to use.  However, I would prefer that the belt fasteners were better attached to the amplifier, but it is a great product and worth the money if you talk alot to save your vocals. On the days I don't use it, my voice is strained."
1373,can you tell me the measures and wheight please,"Hi Bruno, I don't know the exact weight, but is very light.  Measures are 50 cm X 17 cms"
1374,Can a suspend pedal be added,There is an outlet on the rear panel for a sustain pedal. I have just ordered one. Joan
1375,how many strips o u get ....1 or 24,"1 strip has 24LEDs I bought two of those to go with the set I bought before . That set came with 6 strips , 1 pair 12"", 1 pair 8"" and a pair of 4"" but I needed more so I bought a pair of the 24"" now am good to go"
1376,I was wondering how much signal gain/boost this pedal is capable of? Looking to get an instrument level close to line level to feed a headphone amp. TIA,"I'm not sure on a technical level how much signal boost this pedal can provide, and I've seen nothing online either, but I've used it straight into a PA without a guitar amp (it's an amp simulator so that sounds pretty good) and it had more than enough signal to work with."
1377,Does this product come with two speakers or just one? Is the 7000 watts the power of one speaker or of both speakers combined?,The price shown is for one speaker and each speaker handles 7000 watts
1378,"The text says that it is a new ""roller"" bridge, but the picture shows a used ""standard"" bridge... which is it?","You are correct about the photo being wrong for this item, I would contact the seller (Ant Hill Music) to verify, and to let them know.  Hope this is of some help.  Best of luck.  Dave G."
1379,does it make your guitar sound like a banjo,"No, it doesn't. A guitar capo increases the key you're playing in one half step for every fret higher you move it.E -> F on the first fret orE -> F# on the second fretThe higher up you move the capo, the brighter and more 'tinny' the sound of your guitar becomes, and on the higher registers one might be able to compare the sound to a ukulele, however I wouldn't say that it would make your guitar sound like a banjo."
1380,Would this fit on a Squire Bullet Strat? All I really need is one of those little springs,If you're talking about the saddle springs then you can likely either buy those in a bag OR gank one from a retractable pen OR make one by wrapping thin wire tightly around a small bolt or dowel or stick or something.
1381,What speaker ohm rating will this amp take?,"8 ohms single speaker.  The detail says speakers.  And there are two 1/4"" speaker outputs on the rear.  I have not tried those.  Using the speakon outlet, I tried to daisy chain two 8 ohm speakers.  But every few minutes the amp would go into protect.  Maybe the 1/4"" outputs will allow two speakers but not the speakon.  I'd have returned it but this is the only mixer amp in this price range on the market.  I use it for all karaoke shows.  It really does crank great sound."
1382,how much ohm is the speaker inside,8 ohm imped.
1383,Dose this capo work well with a Ukelele? Is it built good enough  to compensate for the smaller size?,I have used it on my ukelele but I thought it was overbearing in size and I had to adjust it a lot to get it to work well.  I wouldn't really recommend it for it unless it was used on a baritone ukelele which has a thicker neck.
1384,Will this crossgrade work with my mbox 2 pro (I'm going from 7.4.2 to 10) and will it work on MAC OSX 10.8.5?!,It should but you might want to chech for any recent updates and your going to need an iLok device to use it. Its a usb key to unlock PT 10
1385,Does it come with pedal,"Donna mine did not, a good pair of headphones are crutial also for those late night practices or hearing it really loud.  The action on the keyboard is superb.  Its by far the best for the money but I would only count on the keyboard a good Double braced stand is better than the one they send also.  Even at that though it plays like my 2000.00 dollar yamaha p200."
1386,What are the dimensions of the neck thickness?  I prefer a thinner neck,thickest neck I've ever played... Think of it as a U shape neck on steroids...
1387,is there a battery in the back for the pickups?,"No, it uses passive pickups"
1388,can it be used with iphone 4?,"Yes, works with 4 & 4S perfectly."
1389,Is this a downloadable version?,I received it in the box.
1390,Will this unit and the Algoriddim app work with the first generation I pad 1?,All ipads work with it. But just the one app
1391,how do you get the wireless mics to work that come with the unit?,"well, besides the hand mic, you can only use one of the two lapel mics. It's either the one with a head piece or the one with a clip. I just put a battery on the black mic box and it was automatically connected to the unit. same goes for the wireless mic. I just inserted the battery, adjusted volumes and it worked perfectly fine for me.."
1392,Is there any difference between these headphones and the one's sold directly by Amazon?,"A model code with be the same as long as it is the same version, the bonus products may be different and shipping speed may be different."
1393,are the strng by defaut good? is it better with   aquila strings?,The strings that come on it sre decent.
1394,Can I use Russion CD,Only if it is a CD+G
1395,is this nylon or steel strings,"Steel string, and what an awesome little guitar. Sounds better than the Baby Martin."
1396,Does it fit an IPAD AIR,"Ionic Rotating Stand Leather Case with SLEEP AND WAKE Functiontion - according to Apple's website, the iPAD Air is a different size than the previous iPADs.  See https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/   So I don't think that this case will fit the iPAD Air."
1397,"My battery went dead overnight. Is this because it was plugged into the amp? There is no power switch. Thanx, Fred","Yes. Its the bad thing on this unit. No power switch to save battery. If you don't use your guitar every day, and afraid to loss the battery if taken out of holder, just cut a rectangular piece of paper, wrap around over the battery holder where the terminals are, and push it to the battery slot. Its the easiest and simplest thing that I think.  Just make sure that the paper in long enough for its easier to pull out from the slot. In short , ""NO BATTERY CONTACTS""."
1398,Can the unit be used with a recorder like the Tascam DP008,"yes you should be able to use it pretty much with any recorder,run from your voice live out's to your line in's on your recorder/mixer"
1399,I want to be able to MIC the THR5 so I can sing along with a ukulele input into the guitar jack. What mic will work with this amp? THANKS!,"I am impressed with this machine.  I think for a noisy place, since you're working with higher frequencies,  you'll be able to cut through it, placed high.  Cardioid, I'd just try what I had available."
1400,come with footswitch?,Yes it comes with a footswitch.
1401,Is this regrind or virgin material? I am in need of very low VOC properties as I wish to use this in a car interior.,"I put the whole 100 square feet in my van under  the stock covering, and never noticed any smell."
1402,How long is the included cable that comes in the bundle?,I  think its 5_foot.  It should be long enough to do what you want to do with it.
1403,Is the se2200a mk mic available?,"The sE2200a II C is currently available, yes."
1404,How wide is each one of the pads?  Do you need one or two per speaker?,"10.5wide  x 13 Long you I only need one pad per speaker. I have B&W; DW601's support them really well, they weight of the speaker doesnt make a dent in the foam."
1405,Is there a reason for the color?,To look cool. Duhh
1406,Does this come with a case?,"It does not come with a case, cordoba  does have some nice padded gig bags for around $25 here on amazon."
1407,Does it work well for flying?,"If this was a carry-on, I'd say no problem, but if it was to be checked in with other luggage, I wouldn't take that chance."
1408,Does the case come with the velvet cover to buffer between the bows and violin?,"Yes, it does."
1409,"How tall wil this go, suitable for standing?  Will the top lay horizontally?  How is it holding up for you?  Thanks!","Yeah, I just extended it all the way, and you can raise the bottom edge (where you would rest your music) up to 48"". You can lay the top horizontally (in fact, it'll flip 180 degrees), and with the knob you can get it to hold pretty tight. I'm not using it professionally, so I can't say to what degree it would hold up when it's regularly being used/abused as it's being broken down on a regular basis. I mostly have had it in one position since I got it."
1410,for what age group?,"I wouldn't recommend this for any age group, very poor quality. You have to almost pound on the keys to get any sound out of it. I was very disappointed when my son opened it on Christmas morning and tried to play it."
1411,Do the keys light up so you know which keys to push or are they just for decoration?,The keys lights up to know which keys to push.  This helps in learning how to play.  I actually purchased this and donated to my Mom's alzheimer activities coordinator.  Mom was an organist for over 65 years and has alzheimer's and doesn't play anymore.  The lights help stimulate her and is a sense of joy for her and her other companions on the floor.
1412,do this 3100gb hohnor panther diatonic accordion come with straps i know it comes with gig bag,yes it does
1413,Hellowanted to know how many boxes they ship,Just one!
1414,"Hi, I'm using two Audio-Technica atr2100 usb/xlr mics and would like to plug in a 3rd source, say Skype or GChat audio.  Will the mixer support this?","Yes, you have two more channels where you can plug in sources with a 1/4 inch jack. I use a 1/4 to 1/8 inch adapter to add in Skype audio through Line In 3/4."
1415,warnenty,One year warranty
1416,What is the calibration range for the tuner? Can it be set to center at A=432hz?,I double checked and the Korg can do an A at 432 hz.
1417,Is the white section lycra or plexiglass?,"It's a fabric, not 100% sure what it is. I expected fiberglass but it still looks and works great. My only concern is that it may tear at some point."
1418,Does this keyboard have Oriental styles and voices? how good are those sounds?,"Looking at it now, I don't find any oriental sounds. Other sounds over all are excellent. A few months after purchas I played a Yamaha psr950. The voices blew away anything I've ever heard except the actual instrument. It's 800 more money , but if you're future proofing it's the one. Also don't know if it has oriental  voices sorry"
1419,Can I create a patch inside the synth? I read a comment online that said user patches can only be created in a DAW,"You can certainly tweak, create and edit your own patches using the MinoNova interface, but it isn't recommended because it's not the most user friendly environment do it in. The DAW software acts as a bonus to alleviate bouncing around sub menus."
1420,Does it work on Mac?,Pass on this partner. I fought with it for too long to be able to return it. $50.00 mistake.
1421,can i add more fish to this column?does the top come off?,"Yes, you can add more fish, I have 8 in mine. Yes, the top comes off. Love my sensory bubble lamp."
1422,"So, can this be used as a LIVE microphone? so the receiver would transmit to your phone, which would connect to a bluetooth speaker??","Yes, it can use with LiveMIC and tramitt the audio/voice to your phone via 3.5mm TRRS audio cable on RX"
1423,Can you or can you not see the lyrics on the ipad screen when you are playing songs off youtube?,no
1424,Is it a 110 or a 220?,110V
1425,Will this work on an iPad 3 with a case on?,"Yes, it will hold a iPad 3 but I can say for certain with a case on it."
1426,Just to clarify this is an Upgrade to cubase 7.5 from cubase le or ai right? Also does it come with a usb elicenser (aka usb dongle)?,"Yes, it is an upgrade from LE  and AI, and, No, it does not come with a USB dongle. Thanks."
1427,WHAT IS TAGALOG,Tagalog is our dialect. Its our main language in the philippines
1428,"Is this a 2-way speaker system or is only a 12"" Sub Woofer?",I describe it as a single mid range speaker . it does have a small tweeter. it has excellent bass response but I would not call it a woofer.
1429,how does the power supply work when you cut the strips?,"You can cut the strips at certain contact points( I think it was every 3 LEDs). From there you can either solder on fresh wires or use premade connectors to the contact points,(+) and (-). It's not complicated at all and easily done."
1430,is this loud,Yes it is!
1431,Would this mic be compatible with a Canon 7D?,"Sure. The connector on the mic is an XLR connector which can be adapted to a mini jack, or a 1/4 jack, or another XLR connection. Just depends what you're connecting it to."
1432,Does the FP02M require a 9V or external power supply?,"No, it just connects with a guitar cable to your foot pedal."
1433,Does it come with a gig bag,"Yes, a gig bag is included."
1434,"Does this korg have an actual attached speaker, or do they mean the internal/built in ones on the piano ? Also how many pounds does this unit weigh ?   M","Internal built-in speakers that, to me, are excellent.  It's not separate."
1435,will these fit a Taylor model 110?,"Yes, I installed them on my Taylor 110.  It is a nice upgrade but only noticeable with new strings.  With old strings, nothing will help the tone except new strings."
1436,does it work in the car? (have 30 pin connector hooked in the car),"I just bought this and tried it on my 2008 Audi A4 with Symphony II+ radio with OEM 30pin iPod connection, and it does not work. It is powered and pairs with my phone, but the radio does not recognize it when music is playing from my phone. Note that this is radio is before the new Audi MMI interfaces came out."
1437,Is it compatible with Windows 8.1?,No drivers required. It's setup by your DAW.
1438,does the software it comes with possibly download to a HP computer??,Yes it does! I have an HP computer and it works great..!
1439,"This baby is good for other instruments too, right? I need a couple of such cables for a synthesizer, to connect it to an audio interface/amp on stage","This isn't an easy question to answer without the specifics of what you're trying to hook up. This is a guitar cable. It is mono and will work well in transferring a low power signal to an amp, etc. If you're trying to hook up an amp to a speaker for example, this is not what you want. For an already amplified signal you'll need a 1/4"" speaker cable. There is a huge difference. One is shielded and meant to carry a high impedance signal to an amplification source, the other is not shielded and meant to carry a much stronger power signal with low impedance. You should Google the specifics of your gear because using this cable for instance to run from an amp head to a speaker could possibly cause major damage. I hope this helps!

1440,Is there a spot for the violin bow.  I don't see it in the picture.,No there is no place to put the violin bow
1441,Does this amp support other instruments like a mandolin or ukulele?,If you can plug them in like a guitar it will work...but they will not have any sounds designed for them...just sounds designed for electric guitar...
1442,what am im post to be looking at,The sturdiness..how much can it hold? It is very good. I still use it in my home studio to hold my most valuable Yamaha!
1443,I have a Pyle 1050 portable pa speaker.  Can I hook that up to this speaker to have a two speaker system at events?,Yes you can
1444,will this work and fit my Samsung galaxy tab 3 7.0 tablet?,with my Samsung galaxy tab 2.7 works good. and perfectly fit. if galaxy tab 3.7 is the same dimensions with tab 2.7 I think will fit too. even with my smartphone lg spirit the keyboard working good too using the word processor apps. hope you got an idea.
1445,does it have selectable drum beats to play along to,It has different things to press but you get the same sound to all of them I wouldn't waste money on it. I returned mine for a refund. I had a problem getting it from the seller BUT !! Amazon  stepped in and refunded my money. This item is the most misleading item I've ever bought. BEWARE OF IT
1446,What are the box dimensions ?,big
1447,"Hi, does this punch out work well on regular paper?",no it does not work for regular paper..just for card stock and plastics to make guitar picks
1448,Does it comes with power supply? Does Power cord is included?,"Yes, power cord is included."
1449,Does this work with the canon t2i?,Works just great.
1450,is this a neck or bridge pickup?,It will probably be good in any position.
1451,Does it have a slot to plug in headphones for previewing?,"No.  You will have to get a USB external sound card.  I got mine off Amazon for only $3.16.  Just search USB external sound card in the Amazon search box.  I got the 7.1 Channel USB external sound card adapter.  It works great.  I'm still waiting for my mixtrack 2 ,but I used the sound card with another numark unit."

1454,Are the 2 extra pres and ADAT input worth the extra $100 (40% more) for the 8i8 (vs the 6i6)? The 6i6 specs & other features seem similar to the 8i8.,"It depends on what you're going to be recording. If you plan on, in the future, needing more than 4 mic inputs (for say, a drumset), you're going to want that ADAT input. Focusrite sells other products like the Scarlett 18i20 and the Saffire Octopre that have 8 mic preamps and an optical output so you can mic up larger ensembles while still only going through one interface. The great thing about going that route is that it's already mapped out through the 18i8 so you can edit each channel separately in your DAW, unlike recording the drumset through an analog mixer and then outputting from that mixer into your interface and only having two channels (left and right) to edit in your DAW.

1455,What cables would I purchase to connect this to my TV?Thanks so much !,"One would have to know a lot more about your TV to answer that. I will try to be very basic because I don't know how much you know about these things. Starting with the speaker (JBL LSR 305) There are two kinds of connectors that plug into the ""jacks"" or ""female"" (receptive) connectors on the back side of the JBL LSR 305; either works. One type takes what's commonly called a ""phone plug"" or phone connector (check ""phone plug"" on wikipedia to see a picture), also called a 1/4"" TRS (tip-ring-sleeve) connector. The other takes what is called an XLR connector. That is how the sound signal gets into the speaker. The phone plug, or XLR connector, are on one end of the cable that will carry the audio signal to the speaker from its source. What we do not know is the source of your audio signal, and what kind of plug or connector needs to be on that end of the cable to plug into that audio signal source. Your TV manual may tell you how to get ""audio output"" from the TV. It may have a jack for what's called an RCA connector, or it may have a ""headphone"" jack. However, the signal source you want may not be the TV itself. For example, my TV is set up so that the audio that accompanies the video comes not from the TV itself but from my Receiver (these are sometimes called an ""amplifier""). That's because I use the speakers with other media sources, like a DVD and CD player and even a phonograph turntable. The receiver is a complex switching system that takes audio in (from cd player, turntable, etc) and puts it out again, often amplified. If that is how your system is set up, check the manual for the receiver/amplifier to see what audio output (""audio out"") jacks it has. Whatever they are, that's the connector that needs to be on the other end of the cable that runs to the speaker (LSR 305). There are TWO MORE points here that are important. FIRST, each unit, or individual JBL LSR 305 speaker, is a ""mono"" speaker, not stereo. It only plays one track, usually a ""left"" or ""right"" track of a stereo signal. So, if your audio output is like a headphone jack, you are going to get stereo output in a SINGLE cable and you have to split that into two, the left and right, and each needs to go to a cable to the JBL LSR 305 that you put on the right listening side or the left (each cable has its TRS or XLR connector on the speaker end). The job of separating the stereo right and left outputs can be done by what's called a ""Y"" cable or just a special ""splitter"" that has one plug on one side and two on the other. Usually a receiver or amplifier, if that's what you're using, will have, already, ""left"" and ""right"" jacks, so you don't need a splitter, just two cables with the appropriate connector on each end. SECOND, the JBL LSR 305 is what is called an ""active"" or ""powered"" speaker. That means it has its own amplifier inside it. Because of that, you need to plug the LSR 305 into an AC source. Also because of that, the signal that you feed into the TSR or XLR jack should NOT already be amplified. Instead, it should be ""line level"" or unamplified. That is the kind of signal you will get from your cell phone or the speaker jack on your notebook computer or tablet. As the other person posting an answer noted, these are professional audio speakers and give a very ""accurate"" reproduction of the signal which you may or may not ""like."" They do have Bass down to 43 Hz, which includes most music, but not the rumbles and noise of some TV broadcasts. They also only give you stereo, not ""surround"" sound. If what you want is accurate reproduction they are great. Optimally, you would try them to see what you think - be sure you can return them if they don't fit what you think of as ""TV sound"".I hope this level of detail is not offensive and allows you to figure out how to connect your TV. You are just going to need some more detail about where the audio signal you want to play through the LSR 305 comes from, and whether it's stereo or already Left/Right, and how to get an unamplified, line level (""line out"") signal. If it's confusing let me know and i'll try to clarify.

1456,i bought four of the lights and i want to use them with a dmx controller but how do i get them to communicate with the system?,"For our application at the church that i pastor we chose to go with the myDMX software package and adapter which we got at Amazon as well.  Reason being it appeared to be far more expandable than a traditional lighting board. It was very simple to get them up and running with a couple of basic scenes. I just chose a light profile (I used a generic one. They didn't have these in the list but I emailed support and they are creating a profile) dragged it over to the lighting scene setup which btw, told me each light address so i could set the corresponding light and then I just moved each slider to the color that i wanted. The generic profile only gave me 3 channels but I really didn't need strobing or anything fancy yet til i get the profile from support. Are you using software or a physical light board? I hope this helps. If I can help more please let me know.

1457,Is it possible to buy an extra pedal to hook up double bass and hihat,You can buy another pedal and daisy chain it for double bass or buy a kick pad if you have a double. Don't think you can add another hi-hat pedal but you can make rims into remote hi-hats.
1458,I got mine today and it had a lot of noise without the mic even being plugged. Is it defective? Is it just the interface?,Go to the Behringer Web site and download the latest drivers for it. The same thing happen to me. Works just fine now.
1459,what do these speakers weigh?,About 15 lbs
1460,"Is this the real esp ltd ec1000 vb, or is it a junior model of some sort? How is it that this bundle is less than the guitar by itself?","The real thing.  The case is a little on the cheap side but I'm guessing that the bundle might have been sold in volume at a discount, I don't know.  I do own this bundle and it is the real LTD EC1000."
1461,Is the bench part of the bundle ?,When we ordered there is no bench. But the latest deal looks like coming with a bench. Check directly with the supplier.
1462,How many tomatoes can you stack on top of the Launchkey before they topple over?,Depends on your balancing skills.
1463,Does this work with WINDOWS 8?,"This was taken directly from Serato's site regarding Windows 8 compatibility:Windows 8 and 8.1 are not currently supported for use with Serato software.

1464,is this dual voltage (as in can it be used in the states with 110v outlets and in europe with 220v outlets and a plug adapter),The back of the amp says 120V at 60 hz only
1465,will this work with windows 7 and amd a6 with 1.4 ghz processor?,Yea Desktop computer? Or laptop? I didn't have any problems connecting. It cones with virtual DJ installer disc free (: the disk has drivers on it for whatever UI you have all the way back to windows xp
1466,"Finish Damage? I used it once, worked GREAT! but when I took it off it left a streak where the finish came off my neck. :-(","This may be due to the type of finish used on the guitar. Most guitars are finished using Polyurethane lacquer - it's hard, easy to apply, and can be applied in states and countries where regulation prohibits other types of finish such as nitrocellulose. It does not react with vinyl or rubber, and is found on guitars of all price levels. The same cannot be said of nitrocellulose (or the celluloid used in some vintage pickguards and picks), which is very reactive and care must be taken when choosing what products to use on instruments finished in nitro lacquer.This isn't a flaw in the product design or materials, but it may well prove worthwhile for potential buyers to check whether their instrument is finished in Nitrocellulose lacquer or Polyurethane and investigate products accordingly. If no finish type is stated on a new instrument, it is generally safe to assume polyurethane, in which case most products should present no risk.

1467,What key?,Key of G major.
1468,Does this have a music stand to hold sheet music?,"Yes.  It has a clear, plexiglass music stand that inserts into the back edge of the keyboard.  It is sturdy and removable.  I remember being pleasantly surprised when I unpacked the box and found it because I had never had one on any of my previous keyboards.  Just another reason to love it.  I've now had it almost 6 months and am still thrilled."
1469,Does it fit the original Rode Videomic?,Yes it fit fine and sound quality is good
1470,Will these fit a person with a large head (Men's size 8 hat)?,"They fit me fine...hat size is 7 3/4, sometime 8...depends on hat"
1471,"Does the keyboard allow for soft and loud tones? If you barely press a key, does it produce a soft tone, and hard produces a louder tone?","Yes, it works as you described.  I was a little surprised by this when I tested it but yes, a soft touch produces a soft tone and a hard touch a much louder tone"
1472,Feel free to laugh a bit and excuse my ignorance. I am starting voice lessons does this microphone only work with a computer? Or can I hook it up to something different? Ok no more laughing. Thank You,"The XLR microphone connector is for Analog [non computer] use, where you connect the mike to an amplifier and speakers. To connect an XLR-pin mike to a computer you need an XLR-to-USB connector or interface. Anything that is USB has to do with a computer. [USB stands for Universal Serial Bus.] This Shure mike came out before the computer era began, which was in the mid 80s - hence it is an XLR mike. Shure has come out with an excellent XLR-to-USB connector called - X2U. It is about $90-$99 on Amazon. You can buy the SM58 with the X2U for $199 on Amazon. XLR mikes need Phantom Power, which is provided by the X2U interface. It is not just an ordinary XLR-to-USB connection Cord. The SM58 (and SM57) is a DYNAMIC microphone, not a Condenser microphone. Just Google - Differences between Dynamic and Condenser microphones. Or - Which is Best - Dynamic or Condenser Microphones? The choice depends entirely upon your particular Mode Of Use. Most importantly, go through all the customer reviews on Amazon. On YouTube there are videos that demo this mike as well as other mikes. Check them out.

1473,I just found out both my AT's antiskate is 100% useless. Would you recomend this for the avid vinyl lover non DJ & any anti skate issues Thanx,yes  dont  sleep  on this  table  no  ani skate  issues  its a  tank
1474,Which one would you recommend this Korg or the Novation MiniNova Analog Modeling Sythesizer?,"Each of the units has comparable advantages and disadvantages. If you are looking for more current dubstep-style bass resonance, you will probably prefer the MiniNova. If you are content to do without that, the Korg has similar classic synth sounds, including trancey industrial sounds."
1475,Can this be plugged directly to a computer for use with on screen recording such as camtasia?,"Technically yes, but the sound level may be too low for it to be useful.  On my laptop, the Realtek audio chipset isn't powerful enough for it.  I use a USB sound card (Creative X-Fi Go! Pro) that does a decent job of powering it.  Condenser microphones like this use capacitors to detect sound waves, and so require a voltage to actively be place across it and for this specific one, built in laptop audio chipsets tend to not provide enough voltage even on maximum sensitivity, it may be a different story on desktops, but I haven't tried.If you are worried, Sony also sells a similar model with an inline battery pack that should work nicely and contrary to the Amazon description, this model does not have one, and is not compatible with any Sony battery pack.  I would personally recommend a USB microphone or one of the $1 ones since they are easier to power, but may not give the clearest recordings.

1476,how long is the cable?,Did a quick measurement and it looks to be about 10 feet.
1477,Do the silk and steel strings sound really bright?,"No, in my opinion actually the opposite.  They have a very mellow tone."
1478,There are about a billion overdrives out there. Is this one better for blues than others like the tube screamer?,"There are different overdrive sounds you can use in blues.The Boss BD-2 is amazing to create a thin Fender sound, and can produce a good amount of overdrive.Ibanez Tube screamer produces a complete different sound, mid range, and is amazing for that.Depending on the guitar player or music you wanna play have must have a different setup.In my pedal board a keep both !"
1479,can you plug an ipod into this amp?,"Yes, definitely. You need a stereo mini male to male cable. I use my iPod with my MicroCube at all my outdoor shows. http://cedarflutes.com/roland_micro_cube.htm Love it!"
1480,"about 10 minutes after tuning the guitar, should the G string break.  Are you kidding me, she hasn't even gotten started?!!!","I pop'd the high e string a few weeks after getting mine, it broke as I was tuning up and I went a little too far.  I haven't had any other strings break."
1481,Can anyone share what interface they use with this mic? I see someone recommended the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2. Any others you would recommend?,"I recommended the Line 6 UX2! Awesome interface, easy to use, looks awesome as well. And cheap!"
1482,are these embossed with the Zildjian logo? I have a set of Zildjian that are embossed.,"Nope, they sound good though!"
1483,What stand do I use with this?,"I use the M179 for voice over work, and I have the mic attached on a floor microphone stand with a boom, but any standard threaded floor stand or desk stand will work just fine.  That said, my recommendation would be to use a floor stand rather than a desk stand.  The M179, like all condenser mics, is very sensitive, so any taps on a desk or typing on a keyboard will be more easily transferred using a desk stand."
1484,What size legs do they hold? are they 9.5/10.5?,9.5...10.5 won't fit.
1485,Can this cable work with non-Yamaha keyboards?,Yes. I use it with my Korg microKorg and it works great.
1486,Can I store my Epiphone Masterbilt DR-500MCE inside this case?,I believe that you can.  It is large for my guitar and it is normal size.  I believe it tells you how large it is in the discription!
1487,"What is the ""diameter"" of the caps?",almost 4 and a half inches - approx  4 and 3/8
1488,What is the nut width and string spacing at the bridge?,Nut Width: 1.725 inches. It would be a standard acoustic guitar spacing. That specification is unavailable.
1489,Can this preamp be used safely with a passive ribbon microphone?,I don't see why not.  I have a instrument/vocal Sennheiser mic running to it.  I turn the DB boost on and it boosts my vocal and instrument recordings.  It doesn't add any hiss either. Just make sure you have the proper XLR cable and I'd say you should be fine.
1490,"Do you have to use the cassettes? I'm not interested in playing along with prerecorded music, just want to play my own music. UPDATE:  Thanks for info.  I got the qchord and pretty  much happy with it.  At least I won't have to tune or replace the strings like on the autoharp.  Very happy that I don't have to use the cartridges since I do prefer picking out my own chords and playing them as I like them. Sound cards aren't much of a challenge.

1491,My at2020 is not fitting help?,The Nady shock mount is not really a 'universal' mount as these things go.  Even the Nady mic I purchase with my shock mount was a tight fit.  You may be able to find some examples online of the types of mounts use with your microphone.
1492,does anyone know the length of the second tier? I want to know if a Kronos X 88 will fit securely on it.,"It has the same width as the lower tier -- 21"" to 37"".  So the width won't be an issue.  However, the center of gravity will be higher so it won't be quite as stable as if you placed the Kronos on the lower tier, all other things being equal.  I think if you have a sufficiently heavy keyboard on the bottom tier (to lower the center of gravity of the whole rig), then it'll be fine."
1493,"Does it have a pre-amp?  If so, where are the controls and what type of battery does it use?  And where is the battery compartment?  THX!","there is no pre amp, or battery. its just a plug in play."
1494,does it come with the screws?,"Yes but it only goes up to a certain weight.  If you have a heavy guitar, then I recommend going to home depot or lowe's for stronger ones."
1495,Is this flute in the key of C?,"Yes, it is a C flute."
1496,How big is this stand when unfolded? Thanks.,"The rail at the bottom is a little over 17.25"" wide.  The wings at the top are about 22"" wide.  The single foot in the back is a little over 6-6.5"" from the front of the book rail at the bottom when it is extended, but it is stable if you don't go quite that far.  When folded up, the entire unit is about  16.5"" long."
1497,will a Yamaha MG12XU fit on the top assuming one has the rack ears for it?,it will not fitYamaha isa 12 space unitthe rack is a 10 space unit
1498,I just got this little guy in the mail today.  It is SOOO light.  Lighter than my iPhone.  Did I get a knockoff or are they really this light?,It's pretty light. The Sennheiser site says it weights 140g if you need to double check.http://en-us.sennheiser.com/e-609-silver
1499,will it fit a revenge?,I bought it as a gift and he put a warlock in it. I asked him an he thinks it should.
1500,Are the Blue Steel a title brand name or steel strings?  I need steel strings for my Dean Markley pickup,Yes the high strings are steel however the low strings are nickleplated steel as it adds to a more bassier tone. Hope that helped :)
1501,does this one have the 4 din pin (4 pin male) connection ?,No it uses a standard Shure TA4F  Connector http://www.micronic.co.uk/store/item/55/4-pin-mini-xlr-connector-plug-ta4f-inline-female-socket
1502,would this fit a fender champion 100?,It fits the champion beautifully
1503,Is the height of the 2nd tier adjustable?,"No it is not.  Only the angle of the second tier and the overall width is adjustable.  This is a drawback of the design as the height and the depth are not adjustable. You could drill new holes for the mounts to lower the height and you can saw off the  arms to shorten the depth, but that is not a fun task."
1504,flashing or no,No
1505,Is this wireless or does it require a cable?,this uses a cable.
1506,I bought this for my son and it doesn't have a cord. what kind of cord do I need?,A 9v power supply (about $10) or batteries for power and any electric guitar connecting cable for receiving signal from guitar.
1507,Are these ball ends?,Yes they are
1508,can you connect a 4 channel power amp to this eq,"No, you need 2 of these if you want to process 4 different channels."
1509,Can I use this product stick on outside of my sink to reduce vibration noise from SS sheet metal sink when the disposal is on?,I would think so.  I personally would use spray on bed liner in a can first then apply this foam.  Maybe some around the disposal?   Make sure you don't cover any air inlet or exit areas on the disposal.
1510,"What are the inputs & outputs? for example: 1/4 inch, or RCA, or mini-jack (headphone sized jack)",Barewire pinch clips. Very secure.
1511,What is the Item (Max & Min) assembled height? how high how low the keyboard can be?,Lowest height 27 inches. tallest 39. at tallest setting there is 9 inches between supports. lowest setting is 30 inches between supports.
1512,Is this price for one or two speakers?,One in a box.  Price is for one
1513,Will these shake my dorm room?,"Maybe for a day before they die on you, don't get these speakers, they aren't any good and they won't last."
1514,Is the accessory pocket large enough to hold a shoulder rest?,Yes...but more room inside case
1515,Are the 18:1 tuners exact drop-in replacements for the 14:1?,"exact fit, just different gear ratio."
1516,"TB-4 has 3 screw holes on each side, the picture shown looks like SH-4. What am I really getting?","If the TB-4 is ordered, the TB-4 will be shipped. Any seller can edit pictures shown on Amazon, but the product data for the TB-4 doesn't change."
1517,will these speakers do a good job on my dell computer i play cds and other music,"I use these same speakers on my dell computer for all my music as DVD move player, great sound. Also, I use these for my recording my accoustic guitar thru the computer. Well pleased with the balance of bass and treble. Does a excellent job for my needs."
1518,"Does it fit 15"".5 up to full size?",yes it is quite adjustable
1519,Is this Ingles Stand suitable for a Tenor Ukulele ?  I like the reports on how sturdy this one is compared to other stands made especially for Ukes.,"Yes it works OK with a uke (just tried it) , but it does have that bow attachment that would be rendered useless."
1520,I have order two other lap harp tuning tools and neither of them are the right size.  Will this one work for the Small World Toys lap harp?,I don't know.  I had to order several harp tuning tools until I found one that would fit my harp.  Is it possible for you to return the tools that don't fit.  Could you speak with the manufacturer of the harp to find out what size tuning tool would fit your harp?  That's all I can suggest.  I'm sorry.
1521,Does this come with a power adapter?,No it does not but you can get a wall wart or power source for one just about any place. I went to Good Will store and found one for .99 cents and it works just fine. You just have to be careful not to get the polarity reversed as the negative is the inside pole and it should be 9 volt direct current with a correct size or snug fitting plug.If you don't want to go on a scavenger hunt I would recommend buying one through this site.
1522,is this the ART USB 2.0 Phono Plus Project Series (which is the current model)??,No. Mine does not have the 2.0 designation
1523,What is the current output on this adaptor?,"I ordered this item on May 26, and received the item pictured (fat adapter with a long cord). The output is DC 9.0V 850mA. Exactly the same specifications as the Casio AD-5 adapter. Both of the previous answers here are incorrect."
1524,what are the demensions?,"INSIDE dimensions: 41"" overall length; 12 1/2"" overall width; 19 1/2"" from neck support to case end (body area); 12 1/2"" from case end back to accessory pocket (neck area)."
1525,"picking one up that comes with a male/female xlr cable. Which end of the XLR needs the 1/4"" adapter if I am plugging into a guitar amp?  Thanks!",Male end.
1526,Does this strap require drilling holes in you uke?,If the instrument does not have a mounting stud then one would be needed. Our mandolin already had one so we did not need to instal one. Our ukulele does not have a mounting stud and we have not used the strap with it.
1527,Does it take nylon or steel strings?,Steel strings
1528,"does it come with the lyrics, or will do you know if the machine will show the lyrics?","The lyrics do appear on your screen, however to my knowledge no printed lyrics included, at least with my disc."
1529,Does this work with Ubuntu Linux?,"Yes,I have tried with Ubuntu Desktop 14.0. It found the USB audio device by itself.Michael"
1530,"what is the difference between H7, K7, M7?","I did a Google search for ""h7 k7 m7 shure"" and turned up a Yahoo article that referenced this on the Shure site: http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3392 ... when I purchased mine, I was thinking that I shouldn't get multiple sets in the same bands, but seeing that article, I'm glad my city isn't listed. There is also a frequency finder link on that page as well."
1531,Do you need to buy an XLR cable?,"Yes, the microphone's cable ends with a MALE XLR. But the cable is somewhat short, you should definitely get a patch cable."
1532,Can you adjust the tone controls on each channel separately?,"No, it's mono equipment. You can connect something like a MP3 player with a splitter (so you don't miss a channel), and adjust volume separately, but it has one EQ only. It works the same for all channels. In stereo sound, the only thing you'll miss is the panning effect, but besides that, the sound is really good."
1533,Hey. How is the metod if I buy the EZ Drumer. download? or FIsical delivery? Than ,"You can buy it either way. I have done both. The Toontrack process at their web site is very secure, so there are a number of steps. You have to do this if you buy the physical product or the download."
1534,I am looking for locking tuners for a Telecaster and amazon gave me this listing for this product. Could you tell me if these would work on a it?,If your tele is an American or Mexican tele with regular sealed tuners (not vintage) then yes. I have put these on both a strat and a tele with a PERFECT fit. The Squier tele's (I had an Affinity series) most likely will have only one hole for the little orientation studs so you have to drill for the second stud. I chose not to upgrade my Squier for that reason.
1535,would this amp work too power my (2) 15 inch stage subs ?,Hell yeah !  I have mine hooked up to 4x10 and I can have the cops over in no time when I fire it up !
1536,Would This Amp be good for singing in bars? Does it do well with microphones? And what kind of Mic would I need for this amp?,"I don't have this amp (yet) but I can tell you that you will need a microphone with a ""low Z"" or low-impedance cable.  The mic input is three prong female so you will need a mic with a low impedance cable which will have a three prong male end to plug into the amp and a female end that connects to the mic.  I recommend a Shure SM58 or SM57 for vocals.  The instrument input is for a typical ""guitar"" cable with 1/4 inch male ends.  Also, I don't think the 8"" speaker in this amp is big enough for bar use unless it's a really small bar and even then the amp would have to be placed at ear level.  This is the only amp I've ever seen that has inputs for both vocals and acoustic instrument (low and high impedance) so I'm buying it just for that feature.  Just make sure that your acoustic instrument has an output for guitar cable or otherwise you will need 2 mics, one for vocals (SM58) and one for guitar (SM57).  I hope that helps.Sam (DOG TOY)

1537,how do you connect this to home AVR or car audio? Heard this was very good for car audio,"I've never heard of this unit being used in a vehicle. It's for PA Management.You go Source > DCX Inputs > (Assign) Outputs > (Each) Amplifier.So Low/Mid/High, you would have an Amplifier for each, and configure those specifically to the specifications of the drivers (You can find these data sheets when purchacing loudspeakers, or on the manufacturers website)As for car audio, it would be possibly however in my opnion EXTREMLY impracticle. You would need an electrical system that can support your load, inverter, then amplifiers and speakers. There are units specific to car audio systems. This is specific to venue, home, soundsystem, ect.However there may be a setup for car audio with a PA Management System, I just can't personally think of how.Hope this helps.

1538,Is this better than the BCD2000? Can't find a precise answer on the specs. Thought 3000 should be better than 2000 but its cheaper so I dont know :/,"Better. No comparison. 3000 is a solid unit, hassle free. But that unit is old,there are other options in that price range now... check out the numark. Or see if you can find a used m audio xponent. Owned that one for years.... way superior to either."
1539,Is it true that different copies have significantly different colors?,"No, all of they are made out of tonewood, which you can't get different colors out of that. But the wood change in darkness, after Time, but nothing to significant"
1540,Would these fit in an epiphone les paul traditional pro?,Yes! They'll fit just fine!
1541,"Is the price listed each, or per pair?","Hello, Pricing is per pair!"
1542,Does an XLR female or male plug into the mic itself?,Female
1543,The cable is resistant and long lasting?,"Yes, you can't stretch it & do not let heavy carts or vehicles drove over it.  I've use mine for about 2 years. I recommend this cable. It also lays flat & rewraps nicely. Ray in AZ"
1544,"Is there a way of inverting the sustain? On my Korg Vintage Stage piano, it sustains when I don't press down.","You have to set this thru damper calibration. If you have a Global setting, you can find this setting .It will explain how to set the pedal up for sustain. Double check your plug in on back of keyboard. It should have a sustain jack."
1545,I see many reviews from the 2013/early2014 stating that the cables are not GLS but actually Talent. Are they still being shipped out as such?,Not sure what brand they are but they work great. No noise just crystal clear audio.
1546,is this fit for air travel?,"I would not trust my guitar to this case if I had to check it, there is virtually no padding or structure.  If you can take it with you into the airplane, then it's fine."
1547,does it works with boss rc3?,"if it's for tap delay pulse, it doesn't. if it's for holding a loop it might. the Hosa has latching buttons. I know it doesn't work with a Tap Delay Pedal since you need rhythm pulsing, with a loop I deduce one stomp would start recording and another stomp would end it (whereas with a unlatching pedal, you'd have to hold it depressed while the loop is recorded and let go to cut it off) Either way you can buy theses switches and turn it into an unlatching footswitch: SPST PUSH BUTTON SWITCH MOMENTARY-ON NORMALLY OPEN"
1548,Can I control 4 1000 watt par cans with this?,"No, each channel is 5 Amps Max, which is about 600 watts. You require a 4 x 1200 watt dimmer for these lamps."
1549,How would you compare to Pro tools? Is Sony PCM better than Pro Tools?,"Pro Tools is audio editing *software,* whereas the PCM D50 is a portable recording device.  The D50 records audio.  Pro Tools is used to edit audio."
1550,does it work with Yamaha YPT 230 keyboard?,Works perfectly fine and it fit like a glove.
1551,I think there is a mistake in the dimensions in the product details section.  Could you tell me what are the correct dimensions? Thank you.,"I use this cover for both my Yamaha CP33 and Alesis QS8 full sized keyboards.  The Yamaha measures 52"" long by 13"" deep and about 4"" tall.  I feel the cover would easily fit up to a 54"" long keyboard, and has room to spare in the height - I measured 6"" of height available.  I hope this helps you - I am totally happy with my cover - no problems or issues at all."
1552,How long is the attached cable connected to the pick up?,"I have purchased both the single coil and humbucker versions.  Both have 8-10 foot cords captive at the pickup and terminated in 1/4"" phone plugs [regular guitar plugs].BTW, the single coil sounds brighter, but will pick up noise from dimmers, other amps [!] and even the microwave in another room, but on the same circuit.  The humbucker is VERY quiet."
1553,Does this work with Windows 8.1?,"This microphone works perfectly with Win. 8.1. That is what I run on my gaming rig, and this mic gives perfect voice quality to my YouTube videos. I don't think this mic really cares about your OS, since it has no drivers to install. It's just plug and play!"
1554,does it include a cable,"No, it doesnt. Just microphone."
1555,is this a 3/4 or 1/2 size guitar that is small enough for a very small 10 year old,"Should work, I bought one for my grand daughter who is small and was 10 at the time. Perfect fit. Although she has not pursued it like I hoped."
1556,"Is this an older version of this unit?  The MSRP here is $599, and I think it's $699 everywhere else.","I believe this was the most up to date unit, they have been around a while and I wasnt aware that there was a newer version for maybe quite some years?  Don't know for sure though, I suspect the price drop (as well as the price drop on the G-system) that has occurred fairly recently is a sign that they may be poised to release some new models? but have searched and found nothing on this subject.  This was a nice unit though!"
1557,"What comes in the box?, I want to be sure to purchase thanks",the product comes in a nice little carrying case. Inside the case is the mic itself and a shock mount to use to attach the mic to a mic stand. There is also a small manual with some stats and user instructions.
1558,do i need seperate power amp for monitors,"Yes. The ""monitor out"" isn't powered, so you'll need to either have a power amp for monitors, or use powered speakers."
1559,Which parameters are controlled by the expression input?,"The EXP/CTL input is used to connect an external foot switch to ""tap in the tempo, in tempo mode.""  I have never tried this input."
1560,are the strings good?,Really people please don't buy this thing. It's a piece of junk. Person who asked about stings yes they are okay but only about one inch off the fret board. You will need a slide to play it. Save your money and just buy a set of strings.
1561,Whats the best Hohner pack that contains all 12 keys? Is there one or do you have to buy them separately?,"the best 'combo' I found was this set of 5:  A, C, D, E and G.................I have added a Bb and an F.......there is room in the case for the two extra I added.   If you have those 7, you are pretty well set ......in my opinion that is.....I haven't found the need for any others yet..........."
1562,Can you plug this into a car?,"Yes, but it's impractical.You'll need to get a power inverter, plug it into the cigarette lighter, and your car needs to be running.You're better off just using NiMH batteries and having two sets of them. This amp will run a LONG time on a set of batteries though. Some people have reported getting as much as 20 hours.-TJ"
1563,How many inches is the foot rest from the ground?,14  inches
1564,"I bought one about three months ago, and my friend just took it back to China and gave it to me. I assemble it but it doesnot work. Why","Well, I have a guess.  The horizontal antenna can not be placed over anything.  If you set the thing up on a table top it will be silent.  You can use a table but then you must be sure the antenna is hanging over the edge.  Or you can use a stand, like a microphone or cymbal stand.  Good luck!"
1565,Range of calibration? (435-445 Hz? Less? More?),410 - 450 Hz
1566,Are those inputs on top of the device? And do you need to plug in speakers to hear sound?,"Those are the Letters Line 6, but no, they are not inputs. You can plugin a mini headphones, or earphones, or Computer Speakers. It's a basic Line out and that big silver know in front is the volume control. I enjoyed this device with Windows XP and Win7, but with Windows 8, it now has Latency that is noticeable, and it will affect your playing left/right hand synchronization. Good for recording Chord progressions though."
1567,will it fit an epiphone LP ultra pro,"I would think so, but I don't have one to try it with"
1568,the description shows two different amplifiers. Which one does this PR 4E Player Pak come with?,"Hi, mine came with the one shown above. I did see that too. Amazon need to change that. It also comes with a tuner you can attach on the guitar. I did buy mine from a local music store. Mine also did not have the CD and did not have extra strings"
1569,"Hi, the included case is a hard case? Can be used to transport the guitar in a flight?","Hi yes it does come in the hard case, and yes it is airline compatible."
1570,Do these guitars come with cases when it gets delivered or does it just get shipped in the box?,Generally they are shipped in the box and case is extra.
1571,Can this play one or more tracks while I can listen as I record another track at the same time?,"Yes you can. It's quite easy to do. It requires headphones, but that is always the case."
1572,How does Amazon pack the guitar case for shipment? Do they fold it? Thank you.,"Delivered in a box in full size. It can't be folded, the case is still hard structured but uses lightweight elements."
1573,Will a Peavey Foundation 5-string bass fit in this case?,It should.  My Peavey Grind 5 string fits perfectly.
1574,I'm wondering when the battery drains.  If I leave it plugged into an amp with the amp turned off is it draining the battery.  All info appreciated!,My daughter has had her guitar for nearly a year. She plays almost everyday. She leaves it plugged in some of the time and has not yet changed the battery. Hope this helps.
1575,What are the size of the slots? Will it hold a standard mic cable?,I have just about every type of cable in these slots and they all fit! This is great.
1576,Does this bell have a clapper?,Yes.  It was fully functional.  I gave it to my 3 yr old and she went to town
1577,will this package come with iLok ?,Yes.. Must to be..
1578,"Does the monitor out jack have sufficient power to drive earbuds (16 ohm) at normal levels? My X2U monitor out is very faint, maybe it's defective?",There is a Monitor dial that you can use to turn up the volume for your earbuds.  I use 64 ohm over-the-ear headphones and it pushes enough power for those.
1579,I am a little concerned about how much post-purchase setup would be required to lower the action. Is this likely to be needed?,Mine didn't.  I think the action is plenty low.
1580,"What does ""Fingerstyle Neck"" mean?",I believe it is in reference to the fret board width or nut width. Typically 1 3/4 inches or wider as compared to 1 11/16 width. Also the string spacing might be a bit wider as it descends down the neck to the bridge. Important to a few and easily adaptable to most.
1581,Can this plug right into a PA channel or do you need some sort of controller?,"No audio output. This plugs into an electronic drum kit, like a Yamaha DD65,Or similar. Then that plugs into a PA."
1582,I was thinking of buying this to mount a Numark CDN77 dual CD player for use in my home studio. Would it be suitable?,"Yes. It will hold any standard 19""  wide rackmount equipment. Note that this rack is designed to be slanted."
1583,Will this case fit the Damien Elite Solo 6?,"Yep.  Thats the case I bought for my Damien Solo 6.  Very solid case, guitar fits in very snuggly.  Almost too snug if you have straplocks installed."
1584,is their any cable that comes with it ? and does it go with female xlr to usb ?,The mic has a standard male jack. The cable is not included.As far as going to usb...I believe you would need a converter/adapter. There are mics designed to be plugged into a usb input.
1585,Any way to put this on a timer so it turns on every few minutes?,For this your have to buy the timer (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001WMFREO?pc_redir=1405404893&robot;_redir=1) which works great with the 1100!
1586,Do you have to put the violin together yourself or does it come already put together? Thanks :),"no, you don't need to, they all come together."
1587,does the surge protector have a port for cable tv?,No....
1588,"Hi, I just bought this stand but I would like to know.....Is there an extension piece I can buy to set the snare drum higher to play standing up?","NO, this is for drumset. You need a concert snare stand for stand-up playing. Yamaha does make them. LIke this: Yamaha Concert Height Snare Drum StandYou could also try a cymbal stand base, if you have one already, try putting the snare top in it?"
1589,does this item come with a carrying strap,"yes, it comes w/ 2 straps so you can also carry it like a backpack-great case-"
1590,is this good for just talking,"Yes its fine for talking, we used it at our wedding so people could hear people in the gardens"
1591,Can I use this software without any other logic software on my computer?,"It is an upgrade, you will need to enter a previous  serial number."
1592,Does this device work with WIndows 8.1?,Yes- I have it running on Win8- doesn't seem to have any issues at all
1593,"Does the receiver have two xlr outputs, one for each mic?  Can it then be connected to a mixer using two short mic cables, one for each mic?",Yes it has two balanced and two unbalanced outputs on the wireless  receiver. Yes it can be connected to your mixer with two short mic cables that will connect each wireless mic transmitter (once the wireless connection has been established) separately.
1594,"I have an older hot rod deville, would this work?",Does yours take rca plug in?
1595,"I want to use this as a stereo cabinet, with my Vox Tonelab LE and a a Carvin Power Amp DCM 1000, how is the sound of this cabinet in stereo????",I am using a Line 6 Pod500X pushed through a Behringer and a Crate into the cabinet and it sounds really great. Mids and Highs are excellent but speakers (or cabinet design) don't push the lows as well as my other cabinets.
1596,Can these plug into my computer microphone jack (I have Audacity already) or a handheld recording device? Do I need anything more to make these work?,I bought them and they didn't seem to work very well. Just fyi.
1597,Does this device come bundled with Cubase Ai software?,"yes it comes with Ai5, halion one is also included"
1598,Does this item fit the P35B Yamaha keyboard?,The LP5A 3 Pedal unit does not work with the P35B Yamaha keyboard. It will not plug into the keyboard. The only pedals available for the P35 are single pedals for sustain.
1599,"does it come with everything? like the charger, and dvd and stuff?",Yes it is
1600,it didn't work i blow at it but there is no sound?,"It's not easy like a recorder.   You need to practice a lot, but once you get used to it you'll like it."
1601,is this good for vocals? for deep voice and rap?,"This is a perfect mic for vocals. I chose it because it had better low-end sound than any other mic in this price range. Very warm, rich sound and crisp clean highs. Better than mics twice the price."
1602,Will this work with Traktor pro and mac?,Yes as long as you install software that comes with and configure Traktor Pro.
1603,I want to connect a lavalier to my dslr. I know this lav is designed for the wireless kit but would it work the same?,"It may, but you will only get sound in one channel. You would be better to get a version that is wired 'dual mono'. We offer it, but not on Amazon, I am sorry."
1604,Does the keyboard just sit on this stand?  this is for my 6 year old-will she knock it off while playing?,"I would not advise this stand to be used for a 6 year old.  It is not very sturdy, there are no locking pieces or lips for the Keyboard to latch to.  I would highly recommend this model instead On Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Stand  I replaced the Casio stand with this On Stage model and couldn't be happier.Hope this helps."
1605,Is this a Tube Amp?,"No its solid state, but the quality is still very high  especially for that price."
1606,Can you take the resonator off?,Yes you can. Its not hard. I haven't played it much without it but it easily comes off. Just need a pair of small pliers.
1607,"how much does the bowl weigh? Wondering if it is too heavy to use on a client to lay on their heart chakra for healing while playing. I have another 5.5"" bowl with good sound, but very heavy.","The bowls I have vary in weight even if the diameter is the same - it is more to do it seems to me with the thickness of the metal shell. Unless your client is very light-weight and frail I'd think it might be worth a go. I can tell you that someone once placed a medium-sized crystal bowl on my back and because of it's wide base as well as thick crystal shell it seemed a bit heavy. The smallness of the ""footprint"" of brass/metal singing bowls seems to better balance it's weight and not seem so heavy. Good luck!"
1608,Does the USB output allow multi-track recording or is it just the mixed output signal?,Mixed output only..
1609,I did not Notice that the mustang bridge has No adjustment screws on top of the separate barrels for fine tuning or intonation.? I hope I spelled that,"No need, the saddles have the propper height for it."
1610,Can I connect this unit to PC microphone jack?,"I would expect you could connect the Pyle mic to a PC. The mic has an unbalanced 2 conductor 1/4""plug. You will need a converter plug or cable to a 1/8"" plug to go into the computer. The computer may be 2 channel in stereo, but the mic is mono, so you may have to work around that issue too."
1611,is this case ready for airplane travels? will my keyboard survive?,It's ready for everything! I transport with it all the time. This case is hefty.
1612,Is the banjo setup or do you have to do some setup work when you get it?,"My banjo was set up almost perfectly from Amazon.  All I did was adjust the bridge a bit back and forth +/- 1/2"" to get close to intonation and then tweak it by moving the upper or lower part of the bridge so that after about 10 minutes it was perfectly intonated.   BTW, it was packed very well from the factory/Amazon.  I was very happy with my first decent banjo and probably could owned it for a lifetime, but as it is: so many banjos; so little time!"
1613,Does ALL of this (including the amp) come in ONE box? I'm asking because I am planning on checking it at the airport for an international flight.,Yes it does
1614,would this amp sound excellent in a high end home stereo system or would it sound too bright?,It would be excellent in any home system.  I have used Crowns for years.  Very flat response across the whole band width.
1615,Does it have a transpose key?,There is a Transpose button that allows you to shift the pitch of the entire keyboard up or down in semitone intervals by up to 12 semitones.
1616,Is this windows 8 compatible?,"We're using it with Windows 7 ( don't use Windows 8 ), but it should work with 8..."
1617,8 months later the sound on my dm50 stays really low. changed batteries and same thing.,Do you know there are 3.volume settings?
1618,Will this case fit a Gibson RD Standard?,I'm almost positive it will
1619,What are the products Dimensions in package ? I'm trying to calculate the shipping costs,Approx 1' Length X 2' Width X 2.5 Height inches per piece... the box it was shipped in that i received was approximately 1' Length X 2' Width X 2' Height
1620,Can the turntable be played with the cover in place? (meaning: set the needle and then replace the cover.),Yes it can. We do this often to protect the records from our crazy kitten.
1621,Can an electric keyboard be hooked up to this?  Can it support a mic at the same time?,"Yes, it has four xlr inputs. Each input has its own gain and eq levels. The four inputs can then be mastered with a master volume. As long as you have the proper xlr adapter for the sound interface I'm sure it would transfer the information of a keyboard. It simply takes four standard mic inputs; one might need some kind of middle unit or wire adapter to get the keyboard's midi output turned into an xlr input. I am personally very pleased with this system for it can function both as a practice PA for band practice or it can be rotated and turned up to be great performance speakers."
1622,Is there a way to connect it to M-Audio M-Track? How would I connect both to PC if both are USB devices and Windows works only with 01 audio device?,"Fist, download user guide PDF from Google. U can use a usb hub (make sure it uses a power supply) to extend the inputs to PC.  Use the accompanying ""ignite"" software to integrate with your DAW."
1623,Does it come with a battery?,Yes it does
1624,Can this be used to tune 7 and/or 8 string electric guitars?,"I Have Tuned a 4 String Bass, Mandolin, Violin and 6 string Guitar with this tuner.  I believe it can be used to tune a 7 or 8 string Guitar."
1625,Does the seat swivel? Thank you.,"Yes, but it can be locked down to stay in place"
1626,Do you sell replacement hinges?,Contact Pennzoni. I'd be surprised if they do not sell replacement hinges.
1627,where can i buy power charger.,You can buy here in amazon or electronics store sometimes in thrift store (used) .
1628,are the CR2032 batteries included with these tealights?,Yes the batteries are included Plus it has a little tab to block it so the battery doesn't get used until you are ready to use it.
1629,Do you remove the cords before drinking your coffee or hold them to the side.,I leave mine plugged in.  I want my coffee HOT!
1630,were is ithis  Q701 MADE? China or Austria?,The white pair i bought in Nov 2013 were made in Austria.
1631,Can someone tell me the size of the pads please? Thanks.,"There are 8 touch sensitive pads (4 x 125mm, 4 x 88mm)."
1632,"Does the guitar come, somewhat in tune?",Somewhat.  Luckily for you a nifty little electronic tuner is included.
1633,Does it fit an ibanez premium 7 string?,Should fit any ibanez it's got a little play in the neck area
1634,When was the  12 maid. what year?,"I purchased it for my Mother for her 99th Birthday as a replacement for one she wore out.  I purchased it new, how old it was, no idea.  It was exactly like Mom's and it had to be 20 plus years old.It is a very good model - Mom swears by it."
1635,I bought this with a Casio SA-76 44 mini keyboard. It worked great with batteries but with this power supply it stopped working completely?,I haven't had that problem with mine.   Would suggest you check circuit breakers and/or try an electrical outlet in another room to eliminate that as a cause.
1636,Is this product good for a kid who is just beginning?,"It is a great product for beginners. I personally would have the kid start out on virtual dj free edition without a controller and see how much they use it so they don't end up just throwing it to the side and never touching it again. Once they demonstrate that they are really into it then I'd say get them a mini controller and then this one, and after that a professional one. However, if money is not an issue, then yes, this is a great product."
1637,will this be enough to run 2- jbl tr225 speakers,I have mine pushing two Peavey SP-15's. Seems to do quite well.
1638,"Does anyone use this unit for live acoustic performance? If so, how does it work in this setting?",Yes   Works well    Just repeats a pattern that is put in or prerecord and use #d memory  ( best to write these down  You can download or create melodies
1639,I see that albums are supported on the outside as well as the center to isolate vibration. Is this a problem when playing 45 singles? Flip the mat?,I have only played one 45 on it. I just played it as i would a 33. No issues with tracking or sound quality.
1640,Does it work on Mac?,"(Digitope) Sorry, no. It only runs on a Windows PC."
1641,"I have 26 key, 12 bass accordion.  piano acordion.   is this the right size case for my accordion?","I have a 26 key, 40 bass piano accordion & it fits like a glove.  I hope this helps."
1642,is this good for public speaking?,The range for moving around a small venue is god but I'm not sure about large venues...from a podium is good but show up early to preset the volumes
1643,"So, i was hoping to be able to plug in a couple of midi controllers, a mic, and possibly a guitar. is this a possibility?","Long answer short, yes. I currently have 3 midi/usb controllers plugged into the usb hub then a condenser Mic and my bass xlr Jack's in the front. All 4 of those have the option for 48v power. There is also one midi in and midi out port on the back."
1644,"Hello! I need to know the actual weight of product packaging, because when I use the calculator of DHL or others  the result is always 2 pounds.","I no longer have the packaging materials but the item weighs slightly more than one pound, so two pounds w/ packing doesn't sound unreasonable."
1645,IS IT PRO TOOLS 10??,"This bundle comes with Pro Tools 9, but you will receive a free upgrade to the latest version of Pro Tools 10.

Do NOT connect the MBox to the computer until the MBox driver is successfully installed.2. Do NOT connect the iLok device to the computer until the iLok software is successfully installed.3. Go to the Avid website and register the MBox and Pro Tools 9 using their registration cards.4. Create an account on the Avid website.  You will receive an email explaining how to get the free upgrade to Pro Tools 10.5. Create an account on the iLok website. You will specify an iLok username that will be used to log in.6. Download the iLok client and driver software packages.7. Close the browser, install the iLok client, then the iLok driver.8. Connect the iLok device to the computer and wait until the computer says the hardware is ready to use.9. Log in to the iLok account using Internet Explorer.  Other browsers won't work.  Add the iLok device to your account. Log out.10. Log in to the Avid account and use the access code received in the email from step 4.  You will be prompted to enter your iLok username.  Avid will send a message to iLok authorizing you for Pro Tools 10.11. From the Avid account, download the Pro Tools 10.2 (or latest version) installer, the Virtual Instruments 10 installer, and documentation pdfs.  Log out.12. Log into the iLok account using Internet Explorer.  Let it add the Pro Tools 10 authorization to the iLok device.  Log out.  Now the iLok has authorizations for both Pro Tools 9 and 10.13. Install the MBox driver.  14. Connect the MBox to the computer.  Verify proper installation by running the MBox controller panel software.15. Install Pro Tools 10.2 (or the latest version) and the Virtual Instruments 10 packages.Pro Tools is amazing.  Enjoy!

1646,"What is the better buy IR110, IR130, or the IR200 and why do you think that?","I own the IR200 but not the IR110 or the IR130.  The IR200 is awesome, it is like shining an invisible floodlight down my sidewalk....it lights up the whole area.  There is no way to walk into the yard without being illuminated.  If it ever malfunctions, I will probably buy another one.  This is in stark contrast to the IR illumination thrown out by the IR LEDs that surround the IR camera I have there (which is wimpy at best)."
1647,Do they stick on with an adhesive backing ?,No. The item did not fit my Peltors.
1648,"which looks more like most shiny brown violins, the natural  or the satin varnish? ( need one that looks like one i already have)",I just looked at my daughters violin she got from the school and the satin varnish looks more like it than the natural color. I hope that helps.
1649,what is the weight of the saxophone with the bag,"sorry it took me long to answer it is about 10 to 15 pounds, its really light. I used to ride my bike, run, walk for 30 minutes to my practice sections and it wasn't heavy. Now the regular saxophone strap is for masochist, so just buy a neotech strap."
1650,"What's the sound quality like?  Not looking for anything super high quality, just curious about the volume and whatnot.","Sound quality is fair...about what you hear out of a portable radio.   The speakers are tiny.  The volume is okay.  I never got mine above halfway.  The unit is more useful for converting vinyl to digital, IMO."
1651,Does this pocket trumpet use the same mouthpiece as a regular trumpet?,"Yes, you can also use regular mutes on it as we'll. everything is the same except it is more condensed. That's all"
1652,"Can you record dry (without fx) while monitoring with fx. Such as record guitar dry, while monitoring with an internal Zoom overdrive and reverb ?",Yes.
1653,I don't want to spend a TON of money on my very first violin but I do want a good instrument with good sound. Is this a good instrument?,"The only bad thing is the case that the violin came with it,  has fallen apart. The straps on the back came off while my child was walking. We sewed the straps back on. We had to glue the handle back on and get the zipper fixed. The case is not well made. Had to buy a new case. Too many repairs.The violin sounds ok. It's a good starter violin."
1654,can this product in australia direct when switch to 230v at the back?,"Yes it can. I bought this a couple of months ago, it was horrible & cheaply made. Buy at your own risk"
1655,does this come with a gig bag?,Mine did not
1656,"Hi, the picture shows 8 lavaliers and 8 headsets for a total of 16, however the description talks about 4 lavaliers and 4 headsets only. Clarify",i have just received this equipment and there are 8 lavaliers and 8 headsets.  The headsets work the best not so ood with the lavaliers.
1657,does this work with a computer?,NO.
1658,How many inches of storage space is available?,"The lower portion has a hollow of about 1 1/4', the upper seat portion a hollow of about 1 3/4', so one could fit about 3' of books under the seat."
1659,how is the case?,"The case is excellent!  Hard outer case, with handle, zips around and has snaps.  Kind of a nylon outside material and inside is black fuzzy and hard shape to fit the ukelele.  Also has a little compartment inside to keep your tuner and cleaning cloths, etc, and a small zip compartment on the outside.  I love the case."
1660,What is the accuracy of the unit? (+/- cents),"Bruce, this tuner is supposed to be +/- 1 cent on accuracy. I do know these tuners have brought out a better sound on my guitars vs an older stand alone chromatic tuner that I was using because of placement variation. For the price I don't think you can beat them."
1661,What brand is the trumpet? And also is it a intermidiate horn?,"I can't remember the brand, my sin has it in school. As if this an intermedia  instrument, it sure sounds and performs like one. I used to play the trumpet in high school in the marching band, when I tried it it was in tune and the sound was great. It performed like a professional $800-$1200 trumpet.James"
1662,I purchased a DS60 from TJMAX. The box says Made for iPad. Will it work on Ipod as well?,"It works via Bluetooth so as long as its an iPod touch, it should work fine."
1663,Is it easy to use and was the quality ok for the price?,"Yes and yes to answer your questions. I lost my old one (last year's x-mas gift) so I got two of them, they really work for me and I find them very easy to operate."
1664,Does it come with the computer?,No it does not and it is not a bad mixer but it was not compatible with my DJ software
1665,Can i use it for karaoke? I already have a xenyx 802 mixer without the effects processor.,"Yes you can use the unit with in all mixing and karaoke systems, it is all a matter of how it's connected.By google you can find different conecting possibilities.I do hope this was helpful, good luck jim"
1666,can u plug microphones ?,I think so. You can plug in a phone/ipod etc and it plays whats on your phone. There is no volume control on the amp for that but I think a mic would work but no volume control.
1667,Can the receiver be use with 230V?,Yes. It's a switching power supply that can be use on 100 - 240V.
1668,Does is fit the DDJ SZ?,I don't think it will. My SX fits petty snug and the SZ is a good amount larger
1669,Can I use this cord to connect to my iPad?,"If you are using an I-rig or similar converter, This will work into your i-rig, and then your I- rig can plug into tour i-pad. This Can not be used to connect directly."
1670,Is the same one that is being used in this youtube video?,"I don't see the youtube video that you refer to. However, the one reviewed by Brian Suman under youtube video titled  ""ErgoPlay Guitar Support Review"" is the same one. ErgoPlay Guitar Support Review<a href=""/channel/UCTVppE2B0jVVwWu5___wKxg"" class="" yt-uix-sessionlink spf-link g-hovercard"" data-name="""" data-ytid=""UCTVppE2B0jVVwWu5___wKxg&quot; data-sessionlink=""ei=C2KwVNTRH8jO-QOs2YG4Ag"">Brian Suman</a>Brian Suman"
1671,How long is the neck from the base to the lights?,"It's nine inches.  I love, love, love this light!  You can use it with batteries or ac plug.  It's very bright, lightweight and the neck is very flexible.  I highly recommend this light!"
1672,Will the Amp be fitted with 240V input power for shipping to Australia?,"My amp only have 120V input option, I can't switch to 240V."
1673,does it come with an iLok?,"yes, unfortunately. it is required and included."
1674,how durable is this version?  My high schooler has managed to break the ball and socket area of his earlier version snarks.,"I think it's pretty solid. I've read reviews of them falling apart as they come out of the packaging (which I'm not saying wasn't their experience), but mine seems well put together. You would really have to pull at the ball joint to get to come apart."
1675,What are the dimensions of this item?,52 inches L X 11 inches width X 4.5 inches height
1676,Does this metronome have a volume control?,Yes it does
1677,is it any good? im a beginner so im not really sure what to expect.,"yup, good for anyone, three things 1) tune it - there are online tuners, smartphone apps, or handheld tuners. but keep it in tune. 2) use you tube for lessons and chords and how to play songs 3) (most importantly) NEVER PUT IT DOWN. practice practice practice. i have been playing for over 25 years and i always have a guitar in my hands even if it's laying on the floor watching TV. good luck have fun, guitars and music has brought great joy into my life."
1678,How do you recharge these batteries without an included power cord?,Use any standard miniUSB cable
1679,I want to know if the mixer brings all cables or have to buy them separately for connecting to speakers and computer?,"The only cables that come with the mixer are the power cord, plug, and USB cable. All other cables sold seperate."
1680,can i connect it to a serato mixer and record music like a pionner player?,Well i use serato with these. My mixer is a gemini. I would think as long as u have the inputs it should work. I assume u have the serato interface box.
1681,Will this fit TRAKTOR S2 + Descksaver? Thanks!,No neither of those will fit only the Numark N4 or something similar
1682,"Maybe a noob question, but using iphone 3GS with ios6 and this instrument, do i need a set of speakers for output??",Short answer is yes. If you want to hear the music at any sort of volume that's louder than your phones ringtone you need to plug one of the outputs from the supplied cable into either a stereo or powered speakers.
1683,Which speakers can I buy that would be compatible with the mics?,"I run mics through a mixer before going to the speakers. This unit has a 1/4"" output and XLR output. (the mixer will handle both and then give you both options to go to the speakers as well)  Note: Most speakers use the 1/4"" input.  I hope this helps"
1684,I can't get the speakers to work with my Android device; it neither pairs for bluetooth capabilities or work with a jack. Any help?,"I purchased this item in 2012 for a family reunion. As soon as I recieved and connected it, I realized immediately that this was a piece of junk. I do not recall how I connected, but I was able to. The sound quality was not even worth the effort it took to take it out of the box and unpack it. I do not believe there is any Bluetooth capability. If it is advertised as such, I am sure the sound quality will diminish even greater. I ended up using a karaoke machine. I can't even believe this item is still listed for sale."
1685,are they uhf and have a selectable freqency,"Yes, they are UHF, but the frequency is not selectable."
1686,What is the difference between this and the Sojing 020A-U? Anything more than cosmetic?,"Yes there are more than just cosmetic (although when you really look at both of them, the cosmetic is pretty strong. Personally I do not like the look of the 020A-U. It looks cheap IMA). The only thing thing I like about the 020A-U is the sides are removable, making it a better travel guitar. I cannot comment on its sound quality. I LOVE the sound of my 020X-U. I did have to lower the action and put a bone saddle on it. I have traveled on a train with it and that went very well! It also stays in tune quite well."
1687,Does this ukulele come with Aquila strings? Thank you!,"Yes, that is what is strung on it...but there is no ""spare"" set if that is what you are asking."
1688,Can the toms be upgraded to any of Roland's mesh head toms?,"Not as far as I can tell.  The toms are built into the system (the cords are actually embedded in the arms).  If you want upgradeable toms, you'll need a more expensive kit."
1689,Does anyone know what strings come on this guitar? I can't seem to find that tidbit anywhere,I can't remember but I believe it's on fenders website.
1690,Does it fit an IPAD AIR,"Ionic Rotating Stand Leather Case with SLEEP AND WAKE Functiontion - according to Apple's website, the iPAD Air is a different size than the previous iPADs.  See https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/   So I don't think that this case will fit the iPAD Air."
1691,is this a mixer and an amplifier both?,Yes
1692,"am buying the boss fs-6 for my roland cube 80, what else do I need to order?   thanks","You might need to buy the cable that goes from the pedal to the amp. Other than that you should be okay. If you have the manual for the cube, it might shed a little bit more light on the subject."
1693,"I ordered this 30 mins ago but I forgot to check the compatibility. I am running Windows 7, does this automatically ship the Windows version?","I am running windows 8.1 and it works, but the bomb factory plugins don't all work.  Just let the sofware load without it.  It works great for my system.  There are plenary of others that do work; all in all it is complacated to install, just follow the instructions.  Bomb factory may all work with windows 7."
1694,"Need good sound for a monthly party (ipod only) , should I get 2 of these, or one of these and it will power a passive speaker as well?",I think one speaker will do it... we use it in our high school gym-- and it get loud... i dont know about the passive speaker... its great!
1695,Will this work on my MacBook?,"Works on windows 8. I don't see why it shouldn't.pro tools 8, 10 fruity  loops"
1696,"Purchased a GLXD14/PG30-Z2 digital system from Amazon, Will this headphone fit that unit? The incl. mic seems bulky","As long as you purchase this shure compatible mic it should work. These are incredibly inexpensive, but I've been surprised by their performance."
1697,Is this a stereo unit?,"No, just a single speaker but it is good and loud.  Perfect for garage, parties, etc.  I think there is only one woofer and one tweater.  Definitely not in stereo but I was surprised by the sound..."
1698,Is this guitar Acoustic-Electric.  Purchasing as a gift & want to be sure it is.,"Yes, this particular model is acoustic-electric."
1699,I am confused by the dimensions.  Reads 9.7 x 8.6 x 0.4 inches.  How tall is the strip and how thick?,"The cross section of the 16 ft strip is about 1/2"" by 3/16"". See my comment to my post. Two of the 3 LED segments have stopped working after one year being exposed to the elements."
1700,will this work if only plugged into my keyboard? or do i need an additional power source?,You should be able to plug directly into your keyboard.
1701,if is good for powered speakers,"If you're not looking to mount them too high off the ground these stand should do you just fine. My speakers are pretty heavy for unpowered ones and the were fine. So all depends in your usage situation if you want them at maximum height in the middle of an open stage, where there is wind, maybe a bad buy, otherwise I'm extremely happy with them for the price I paid."
1702,"Just so I am clear on what is included, there are no hand held mikes, but 2 lavaliers and 2 headsets?",There are two hand held mics and two transmitters each with a lavalier microphone and a headset micrphone. You can choose which you want to use. We ordered the separate mini headsets that are less noticeable than the ones that come with it. We also ordered an additional handheld to use instead of one of the transmitters when we need a third handheld. Just program it to the same receiver channel.
1703,Hi.  Is this flute solid silver?,"No, it is 100% nickel silver (silver plated) excluding the gold lip plate"
1704,what is the recommended age group for a junior drum set,"My grand-kids are 3-8, however their parents also played with the drum set.  My only suggestion is to buy a timer prior, so you won't have any issues with sharing"
1705,"Can this mixer control the audio input from USB cable or RCA ? It do have controls(EQ,level, comp, etc) for all 12 channel, but no control for USB or","No, the USB/RCA ""returns"" can be sent to the Headphones or Control Room Output; but not as an Input that can be actively mixed.  This return is more of a confidence audio return."
1706,Does this guitar come with a built in tuner?,Yes it does.
1707,Is it ready to use out of the box or do I need some special equipment to make it work?,Plug and play!
1708,is the charger quality good?,yes. I havent had any problemI keep it plugged 99% of the time
1709,when 4/4 time click can the 8 or 16 note click along for each 4 count?,"In 4/4, the quarter note has the beat. The eighth is twice as fast. The sixteenth is 4 times as fast. If the quarter note is 60 tempo, then eighth is 120 and sixteenth is 240. For the eighth, set beat to 2 (two eighths to a quarter beat). Sixteenth, set beat to 4 (4 sixteenths to a quarter beat). Meter only goes to 240 ca. so any faster and you are out of luck. But quarters and eighths are normally within range."
1710,What is the radius of the string saddles on this bridge?  Thanks.,"It's a 12"" radius, Gibson standard. I put it on a Gretsch with a 12.5"" radius and it was fine."
1711,"Is it suitable for a 3rd grader  (9 year old) learning clarinet for the first time.  If not, any recommendations such as Yamaha or Buffet for him?",Absolutely! It's perfect because it has the warranty for entire time the child is in school. :)
1712,So is there a iPod slot for playback and charging,NO...USB port for flash drive only..
1713,How well does this the fit the iPad Air?,"When I bought my Hercules holder I had an iPad 1. Recently bought an Air. The iPad Air does fit although it is about 1"" narrower than the old iPads. It's not a perfect fit but good enough that I'm gonna keep using it. Good luck."
1714,Can these be washed if they get dirty?,Yes
1715,What is your experience with the mallet that comes with this drum?  Any advice on choosing an alternative?,"remo mallet heads actually sound good with remo drums ... however, the handle/stick is a light-weight dowel ... so, even though the beater head looks cheap, i replace the handle/stick with a natural stick with more weight and ergonomic appeal ... another option is to cover the the felt beater head with a light-weight leather as well as replace the stick ... otherwise, like most personal preferences, you'll just have to try different commercial beaters or make your own -- best, e"
1716,Do you a self teaching manual my uncle taught himself on his flights with ransa as a pilot,"There is an excellent website, micuatro.com that teaches you how to play and has lots of songs. Check it out!"
1717,Do you need any additional hardware to get started in Reason Essentials?,"I recommend an LPK25 MIDI keyboard and some headphones. That's my setup including reason essentials (I do have some m-audio bx5 studio monitors, but you don't need them just starting out.) I plan on upgrading to full Reason 6.5 or 7, but not getting any additional equipment right now. Hope this helps. Have fun!"
1718,does it come with any warranties?,All digitech products come with a warranty.
1719,I NEED CONNECT 10 STRIPES WHAT DO YOU RECOMEND ME,"Buy 4 of these 3 to 1 splitters (http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61TemWV9nHL._SL1500_.jpg).  Connect the single side to your 12V power supply then connect 1 TSSS Data Repeater (amplifier) to each of the 3 ends of the splitter (you will need 3 amplifiers).  Use the other 3 splitters to connect 1 to each amplifier.  This will give you 9 plug ins for your 9 lines and you will not have any power issues.  This is probably overkill, but the parts are cheap and you are better off having more available capacity than too little.  TIP: To keep things clean I attached heavy duty velcro to the back of each amplifier and the 12V power supply and stuck them to the wall.  Buy way more wire (http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71ekjJHHuAL._SL1500_.jpg) than you think you need and use these (http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41q%2BhzsWiQL._SL1500_.jpg) on the amplifier end of the wire and cut these in 1/2 then splice them on the light strip end (http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71j87VtkuhL._SL1500_.jpg) to make everything ""plug-and-play"".

1720,can this fit taylor 214CE? Thanks.,"I don't know. I have a Taylor 314ce. It fits that, with room to spare."
1721,what is the best interface to use with this software?,"There are tons of interfaces that work, ""best"" is certainly going to depend on your specific needs. I've used both Steinberg's UR22 and NI's Komplete Audio 6, and they both work great for me."
1722,"my guitar has nylon strings, will this pickup work? if not, which do you recommend? thx","No it won't work with nylon strings. Your best bet is an undersaddle pickup, but they require professional installation and drilling a couple of holes in your guitar. If you're looking for an economy option you can put in yourself, take a look at stick-on transducers (aka ""contact mic""). They sound decent if you install them under the bridge."
1723,Is the neck of this guitar the same dimensions as the Hummingbird? Is it as good as the Hummingbird?,"Please be advised, The ""Pickguards"" are NOT the only difference between the Dove and the Hummingbird guitars. While the dimensions may be identical, the woods used are quite deferent. They both have solid spruce tops. However, the Dove has laminated ""Maple"" back and sides, while the Hummingbird has laminated ""Mahogany"" back and sides. And these two woods produce a distinctively deferent tone."
1724,What type of wood is it made of?,Its made of a soft kind of wood. I do not know the name of it but the guitar sounds really good after tuning.
1725,i cant get the display to work to see the words???     first time hooked up,"Unfortunately I've realized this specific machine has a short in it which is a manufacturers error. Either the microphone won't work, the screen won't work or the speakers. Send it back."
1726,First...mounting on brick? Second better quality when set up with no space between the tiles? or does it make a difference?,"Let me save you the time. This is purely cosmetic. These panels are no where thick enough to absorb any real frequencies. Only the very high ones. If you are tryn to treat brick you need to go with something serious like the rockwool made panels. But to answer your question yes you can stick them to brick or really anything with the 3m tape tabs. And as far as spreading them you can do it again for looks. It's not going to make a noticeable difference unless you covered the entire space and even then it would just sound dead and boring because you would block all the highs and leave the mids n lows to roam freely.

1727,"Is it a MIDI device? If so, is the instrucment downloadable?Can the MIDI instrument (ex: violin) directly to a recording track?Is it via USB port?",It is NOT a midi device.  It is a midi Channel.  As such all it does is connect your PC to a midi device using the correct protocols.  That's all it can do.   See instructional stuff all over the web for understanding.
1728,Can this item be used by itself or does it need to be plugged into an ampllifier in order to work?,"Hi Anne, You do need a amp., I use a little Peavey Solo and it works just fine. Hope this helps, Mike"
1729,Does this come with a case?,"Unfortunately, no. And I don't think it fits nicely in most hard cases."
1730,"Has anyone tried taking this bad boy to the beach and if so, how did it do?",Never to the beach but to the sand dunes. Even with atvs buzzing around it still worked great. Battery lasts
1731,2 Questions. 1)  Is it USB MIDI Class Compliant?  Will it Work with Linux?  2) Is it USB powered or do you have to plug in a brick?,"1)Yes, it is USB MIDI compliant. 2) It is USB powered."
1732,Can it run on battery power?,It runs through USB when using it with a Mac. You need the power adapter if using with an iPad.
1733,If I have these installed close to each other (36 in apart) can I program each light a different color or will they all pick up the same RC command?,"If the lights are installed closely to each other, they are very likely to pick up the same signal from the remote when you operate the remote. However, you can create a physical barrier and ""isolate"" the light bulb that you need to be a different color."
1734,Does the Gretsch G9500 have an adjustable truss rod?,yes
1735,Im hoping to bypass the Fishman software and use it with NI Komplete 10 Ultimate does anyone have any experience with that? Thanks!,It will work with pretty much any MIDI instrument. You will just have to program your own combis and layers in your DAW. Thats the way I use it most of the time because the Triple play software needs to be updated to be compatible with the newest software instruments that are available.
1736,"Received this today, and the display is in black & white - is that correct? Not sure whether to return or not.",When I received  my it did not work....it should not be.......
1737,I'm hearing sound in only the left ear piece.  Shouldn't the transmitter send both channels and the receiver receive both channels?,"You could if you had two XLRs and two mics for left and right. Then you would have both audio channels.  Otherwise you have just the one channel and one mic.  I prefer just the mono while shooting and recording.  Then I balance it out in post, and in stereo."
1738,how wide is the light?,It's about 8 inches wide.
1739,"How many lumens per LED, Meter or Roll?",600 super bright leds. Lights up as bright as a good floodlight.You can't look straight at them.  I am using it as a fishing light with no outercase they are waterproof.
1740,Does this bundle also come with a sustain pedal?,Yes
1741,does this fit the blue yeti?,Not at all. It seems to only fit a traditional size microphone.  The yeti is too thick.
1742,"Firstly, how do you use a midi device such as a keyboard with this?",Directly you cannot plug a MIDI keyboard to this. This is purely audio interface without direct MIDI In/Out. You can use it with DAW. NOw if you want to use MIDI Key board then if your keyboard has USB MIDI I/O you have to connect it to your laptop/desktop. Your MIDI will be available in DAW or other MIDI enabled program. If your keyboard has only 5-pin MIDI IN/OUT then you have to get a USB-MIDI interface or a MIDI/IO Card for desktop. If you want more clarification please reply. Thanks.
1743,works on windows?,Yes
1744,Can you use speakers with the cover on? To protect speakers when on the beach?,no
1745,I want to play my ipod directly through this subwoofer. Will one xlr to 3.5mm cable be sufficient?  I noticed there are 2 xlr inputs (left/right).,"You can do that if you plug it in on the left channel, although i wouldn't do that, it is better if you plug your ipod to a mixer (miniplug to rca). then use two cables from the mixer to the sub (xlr left and right), hope this is useful to you"
1746,What type of battery does this use?,CR2032...you can get them at Amazon or most pharmacies...
1747,Does the box have 1 or 2 of the lasers in it?,1
1748,I want to make sure that this bundle also includes the power supply for the Casio Privia PX150 88 key digital piano,"Yeah, it does. I'm looking at it right now."
1749,It seems to have more tick marks to either side of center than the few bars on a snark.  Does this mean it has better resolution?,"I own the Korg Pitchhawk and it works pretty well. I also own a snark, a couple of d'addario mini's, and a Intellitouch rechargeable. They all work pretty well. My favorite (my go to) is an Intellitouch PT10. I own two of them and find them the easiest to use and am pleased with their accuracy"
1750,"Do you get 1 or 2 speakers for $1,145 ?",This listing is for one speaker. A set of two will run between $2000-$2500.
1751,"Is the strobe mode more accurate than the needle mode, or is it just a display preference?","NOT just a display preference. The strobe is much more accurate. Standard modes are 0.5 cent accurate and strobe is .1 cent. From T.C. Electronics website:""Chromatic ChampBesides the Polyphonic tuner, PolyTune has a chromatic tuner that can hang with the best current tuning technology out there, with an amazing 0.5 cent accuracy.-----------------------------------------------------------------Full Strobe AheadThe strobe tuner in PolyTune 2 is super accurate and super fast.

1752,Is the 12 hole alto c legend of Zelda ceramic ocarina sold from Ocarina Wind worth buying? What is the sound quality?,"I hate to speak outright negatively of a product, but in this case I don't feel that it can be avoided.  The sound quality of the instrument overall is very low compared to almost any other ceramic 12-hole ocarina.  Moreover, this ocarina can't even come close to playing some of the notes a 12-hole is supposed to be able to play - the D, E, and F at the top of the range reached by lifting the thumbs and left-hand pinky, and the A and B reached by covering all the holes plus the sub-holes.  I think almost any alternative would be better."
1753,Can I play my iPod nana on it,"maybe if you can get the unit to work! I had to exchange the first one because it would not come on and the second one, now, will not work at all.  There are better options available..."
1754,Can I use it on Android?,Yes. I use it on my old LG Vortex android.
1755,can i rip music from a dvd of the crossroad concert to my music w8.1,I have version 1.1 and it does not have an option to rip music from a DVD.
1756,Is the correct stand that fits this keyboard being supplied now.  Too many complaints about wrong stand.,The keyboard just sits on the stand. There is no securing it so it feels stable.
1757,I need to be able to have it give small bursts of fog every so often.  Will it do fog on demand?,"If you use the remote, you may turn on and off as you wish which would include short blasts.  The attached on/off switch would also work but it puts you inside the fog."
1758,I'm trying to learn music from scratch and i want this item for practicin/learning. Should i get this one or the Launchpad Mini?,"It depends on your mixing speed and finger placement. The regular size novation pad have slightly bigger buttons than the mini, but they both work the same. I purchased the mini because I downloaded the app on my iPad mini, so they work together. I'm just learning myself so I wanted to start off with something small and not too expensive just in case I lost interest in it. I'm still having a blast with mine, it's so much fun creating your own beats and music. Hope this helps out."
1759,Will this work with an Android-based tablet?,No it's only compatible with Apple's iPad and iPhone with the lightning connection. But you can use it on any computer  usesing the USB connection with its software.
1760,"Do you get everything in the download version as in the DVD version? All the extra sound, etc?","I believe there are extras but since my speakers blew out and I ordered new ones from Amazon, I won't know until I start working w/the software.  I'll update by August.  I make local color films and music videos.  I'll definitely reconfirm.  It's a good product and I've already put one track there and need to record a vocal over it.  Opening the program it looks pretty extensive.  Be back w/more later."
1761,Does it work on 220V?,no
1762,Can it play full chords ?,Yes
1763,I want battery operated outdoor fairy lights to wrap around a palm tree.  Would these be the best kind for that purpose?,No
1764,"It would be helpful to see a couple of examples of cell phones this will work with, and won't work with (I'm particularly interested in the S4)",I have tested with the iPhone 5 running a jailbroken version of iOS 7.1 and it works great!
1765,Can you record videos with another app (like ProCamera 8) using the iQ5? I need this app for change the resolution and control focus.,Yes
1766,Should I buy this Mixer or the Mackie ProFX16v2?,"I can't say for sure which mixer is better but I have had excellent results from the Yamaha MG16XU. It has worked flawlessly and we have even had some gigs where it rained and the board got wet and the table it was on blown over. I just wiped it down, let it dry out, and it is back in business. I think the Yamaha rocks!"
1767,how does this connect to an audio reciever like yamaha rx-v773?,"There are several ways.  If the receiver has a phono imput (and Yamaha phono inputs are some of the best on the planet!! -- that's how I would go.) use that with RCA plugs.  If no phono input, and you want to use rca plugs (analog) -- there is a switch which activates the turntable's internal phono preamp, you can use the auxiliary input (aux.).  Finally, you can use a (digital) coaxial cable.  The turntable also has a digital output.  So you can take your pick."
1768,Will this work on GO PRO 2?,"Yes, it will.  You can also detach the cord and plug only the mic itself to the GO Pro.  You might find it bulky, though."
1769,"Which shock-mount goes with this mic for recording? Is there a good reason to use a shock mount for live performing, or are they just for recording?","A shock mount is not used with this kind of microphone.  Just a typical microphone holder will due. This microphone (e835) can be purchased for less than $100, and should come with a storage bag and a microphone holder. In fact, on Amazon you can buy everything you need for $99, including a bag, mount, and stand from Sonic Sense.  Just search Amazon for e835 and you will see it. Btw, I don't work for Sonic Sense and have never purchased an item from them, just thought I would give you a heads up. Of course, the decision is yours as far as who to purchase from."
1770,How tall is this rack from bottom to top (height) ? Wondering if it will fit under my 5 inch desk space.,"It's about 6.25"" tall"
1771,"What is better for recording and mixing guitar, vocals (for metal). And mixing them. AKG 240 or Audio-Technica ATH-M50? Why?","For sound quality, I would go for the AKGs. To me they have a much flatter and cleaner sound and have excellent mids, which is good for mixing vocals especially. The Audio Technicas are good headphones and have better bass, but the mids are a bit recessed so they aren't the best for mixing vocals. However, my experience with the K240s is that the build quality is very poor and they break very easily. The ATH-M50's have much better build quality, so that's another thing to consider. It doesn't matter how good your headphones sound when they're broken. One last thing is that the AKG's are open backed headphones whereas the Audio Technicas are closed back. So if you want to avoid feedback during live recording, the Audio Technicas are the clear choice. I hope this information helps.

1773,Does it include carrying strap?,"Yes, the strap is included. It is a great case!"
1774,What type of cord does this require?,"This is an extremely popular pedal, so nothing unusual is required.  You need a standard guitar cable (1/4"" male mono plug on both ends) to go from your guitar to the input jack on the pedal.  And you need another cable of the same type to run the signal from the pedal's output jack to the input jack of your amplifier.  Good quality cables about 15 feet in length typically cost about $20 each.  You shouldn't buy cheap cables, but I don't see any need for anything more expensive than between $20 and $40.If you're talking about an AC adapter so that you won't need batteries, I suggest the One-Spot.  About $35 and works great.Hope that helps.

1775,Is this a left handed guitar?,"Mine is right handed, but you could order it left handed.  All they need to do is reverse the strings for you.  They are excellent at pleasing their customers ( The EPIPHONE people.  Just let them know of your request and I am sure that they'll take care of you.  By the way, I love my guitar (Epiphone DR-100 Natural)."
1776,which color is heavy?,The purple 1.14 mm pick is the heavest. I bought the yellow .73 mm which is about medium. If you buy a variety pack you will get all the way from the lighest to the heavest.
1777,how long can one gallon of fog juice last? how much fog does one pint produce?,"I'm not sure exactly what the answer to your question is, but I can tell you this. On Halloween we filled the reservoir. It didn't even use half a quart, and it lasted all evening, with us releasing fog every few minutes, for a total of more than an hour. Hope that helps."
1778,How long is the cord?,9-1/2 feet
1779,"Will it work on electric guitar, too, or just acoustic?",Yes.  The part that grabs the peg has a smart shape that will grab onto most pegs from acoustic to electric to bass guitars.
1780,is it good,oh yes very good but I call her Ugly Betty'
1781,Does it have a gear compartment?  I.E. Storage for picks and tuners?,Yes
1782,wil this fit a bc rich warlock guitar?,"No,  don't work for this model of bc rich, sorry for my english, I hope you understand me. Bye.. It's case is for model like LTD JH-600"
1783,Does this come with a power supply?,"Yes, it comes with a DC adapter you plug in to the wall outlet. It's a little weird because it doesn't have an on/off switch, to turn it on or off you just connect or disconnect the power cord."
1784,What ligature works well for a Pomarico ruby Clarinet mouthpiece?,"According to the forums, you should try a BG Silver Revelation Ligature. I use a Vandoren mouthpiece, so I can't verify this information personally."
1785,what are the lengh and height of this case?,"Outside dimensions are 49"" long, 16"" wide and 4' deep"
1786,"most companys are proud of their warranties. Do'es the dr-212, 12 string even have a warranty? george lee","Yes, it has the Epiphone Limited Lifetime Warranty.  You can look up the details at this URL.  Just scroll down the to DR-212 model for them.http://www.epiphone.com/Support/Warranty.aspx"
1787,"How ""foldable"" is it?  Looks like base collapses and stem may retract, but otherwise doesn't look like it gets very portable without a carrying case.","If you're looking for a really portable stand, you'd do much better buying one whose music-rest folds up. That part of this stand is a very sturdy tray measuring 18+ inches x 13+ inches . The value of this stand is its solidity, not its great portability."
1788,Will this case fit either Epiphone Dot Studio or  Casino?,"Yes, I bought mine for a Dot Studio; not sure about the Casino. It's a perfect fit, Love it!"
1789,"Can you use this to hang a ukelele also, or only a guitar?","This just barely grips my baritone uke (the largest type), so I'd really recommend the CC01UK - which I also own.  As mentioned in another answer, you could probably pad the forks of the hanger to get the right fit, but your uke would hang farther out from the wall than you might like since the CC01K is designed for deeper guitar bodies."
1790,does it work with the blue yeti,"No. I bought it the same time I bought the Blue Yeti and while you may be able to stretch it over about half of the microphone area, it won't do what you need."
1791,"Which cloth would be suitable for cleaning my flute? I'm looking for a good cloth to clean the inside of my flute with, using a metal rod.","This might be a bit thick for that...I use it to clean off the outside of my flute, which is rose gold plated.  It would probably absorb enough to work, I'm just not sure if it is thin enough to get through the whole flute. I can recommend an awesome product for cleaning the inside of your flute & it doesn't require a metal rod, but it's not sold on Amazon.  If you're interested, email me @ crazyflutist0804@gmail.com"
1792,"I need to boost a dynamic microphone before going into computer. Mic has 1/4"" output. Would this work?",This will work perfectly. As long as you are positive your mike and computer are working correctly. I use mine every time I use a microphone. Just turn up input gain until you get a little yellow on loud vocals and set output to desired level. It also will provide power to a condenser mike where a computer typically wont

1795,Will this item fit a MIM Fender Jazz bass?,I'm pretty sure it will
1796,Can I use A Samson GTrack with this stand?,"It's an industry standard mic stand with a standard screw in top. If your mic has an industry standard screw hole in the bottom, then it will fit."
1797,"Would I be able to play this, with small hands?  I've heard the bent neck and keys should make it playable for me.","I have short, stubby fingers, and the bass is easier for me to play than the Yamaha tenor is.  I can't play the basses that you blow into to the top because my arms just aren't long enough, but I have no problem with this one.  I just measured my hand span with a ruler, from the tip of my thumb to the tip of my little finger, with my hand spread, and it's 8"".  It seems like a little bit shorter would be ok too.  Hope that helps.  Good luck!"
1798,can this fit a 22inch bass drum?,"nope, definitely not"
1799,"Does this soundproof a room, even alittle bit?","This type of product doesn't keep sound that originates outside of the room from entering the room (such as road noise), it keeps sound that originates within the room from bouncing around inside the room.  In other words, it reduces room echo."
1800,How long can it produce fog continuously?,"No fog machine in this price range can continuously produce fog.. This machine only being a 400 watts, has a bit of a warmup time. (about 5 minutes) Once warmed up,it will blast out fog for about a minute and a half, and then it will have to warm back up (But not as long as the initial warm up when you power it on.. I've personally used this machine for parties and gigs where I DJ..And at home, I can fill a 20 x 30 ft space from floor to ceiling with about two blasts.. As a suggestion though, don't use the fog fluid that comes with it.. it is JUNK! The higher quality of fog juice you use will aid in this machines performance dramatically..

1801,Can this be used on a strat style?,"It could be, but you might have to route out the body, or alter the pick guard, if the original guitar had a single coil.  I was not impressed personally with the sound of this pickup when installed.  I would spend a little more and get a Seymour Duncan."
1802,8 months later the sound on my dm50 stays really low. changed batteries and same thing.,Do you know there are 3.volume settings?
1803,Does the vioin case have a handle?,It does not.
1804,Is it 1 speaker or 2 ?,Price is for each speaker.
1805,Regular CDs can be played also?  I'm not savvy on this stuff at all.  Just want to listen to my CD's and tapes and have the karaoke for kiddos.,Yes you can use it as a CD player with no problem.
1806,Will this case fit a Fender Modern Player Marauder?,"The Maurader is an oddly shaped guitar, so I wouldn't count on it fitting snugly in this case. It would likely move around. Nothing a little bit of creativity and leftover gym shorts can't fix."
1807,"Would you send it to New Zealand? If so, what is the International shipping fee? Thanks","Unfortunately, we are unable to ship any of our Amazon orders outside of the United States."
1808,Can this be used in a 12v car audio situation?,"It is AC, not DC. But you can get an inexpensive power inverter and plug it in that way."
1809,Does this come with a power adapter?,No it does not but you can get a wall wart or power source for one just about any place. I went to Good Will store and found one for .99 cents and it works just fine. You just have to be careful not to get the polarity reversed as the negative is the inside pole and it should be 9 volt direct current with a correct size or snug fitting plug.If you don't want to go on a scavenger hunt I would recommend buying one through this site.
1810,oops I meant to ask does it come with shoulder rest and chin rest?,"No shoulder rest, just comes with the chin rest. You can use a cloth for shoulder rest."
1811,"Can I record four simultaneous discreet tracks on ProTools, Garage Band or Logic Pro, etc. using this?","Yes, but you'll need an external ADC.  Two inputs are analog, two are digital."
1812,what size is this speaker? is this one aprox 32 inch tall?,"http://qsc.com/products/Loudspeakers/K%20Series/K12/(NO, THE DIMENSIONS ARE 23H X 14X14"")"
1813,Does it have a USB plug for connecting to a PC or just a stereo receiver plug? Amazon should have shown additional pictures of it.,"Just the 1/8th stereo plug, no USB."
1814,does it fit 12 string guitar like the guild,I have used mine for a 12-string Luna; the Guild should fit as well.
1815,Can the double bass bag fit two 5 string basses or a 5 and 4 string together?,Any variation!  I use it for two huge 7 string basses!
1816,What does this do that a multi-meter will not?,"First, cables can be plugged directly into the connectors on the box, which is much faster than connecting multi-meter probes. Secondly, intermittent connections can be found by wiggling the cables. Intermittents are indicated with a separate set of LEDs. I checked cables with a multi-meter for years and missed several intermittent connections. This is FAR superior."
1817,"Does this need balanced or unbalanced 1/4"" TRS cables for Main Out L/R?","I'm not 100% sure, but I know I use unbalanced outs with no issues."
1818,Can These Be Daisy Chained?,"From what I understand, you can attach as many as you have free USB ports (not into a USB hub but straight in to computer) or up to 2 additional via the midi ports on the units themselves."
1819,"The speaker I am wanting to use these through has a DVD/TV input (the red, yellow and white cords) will this still work?","Base on your description, I believe you have an amplified speaker. All you need is a mono to stereo audio cable that has a 1/4"" in one end and 2 RCA on the other end. plug the rca side to the white and red input, and the 1/4"" end to the mic receiver."
1820,"For a first timer what is your opinion, an Ovation 148-rrb vs a Yamaha 730 series ?",I own both the Ovation and the Yamaha. In my opinion the Ovation has better action and richer sound. The ovation also has a very easy adjustment to lower the action. The down side is that the hard case for the ovation  is more expense. How that helps.I own 2 Yamaha's 6  & 12 also 2  6  string Ovation.s
1821,What are the inside dimensions?,"since its a soft sided case its a bit tricky to measure but see if this helps:  My keyboard is 51 inches and with it pushed up against one end of the case I have 2 in of clearance at the other.  Front to back my keyboard is slightly over 11 inches and I have closer to 2 1/2 inches extra in the back.  My estimation is there would only be about a 1/2 in difference in either direction between the outside dimensions and the inside dimensions.  This is more of a ""gig bag"" type case which was exactly what I was looking for.  It is light weight and doesn't add too much to the problem of carrying the keyboard from place to place and keeps it clean and dry in between.  Nice strap for putting over your shoulder. It is not a highly padded case that would protect a keyboard from something heavy being dropped on it for example.  Good luck.

1825,Can it be connected to the tv (in) if the tv is connected to a sound bar (out) so I can do karaoke?,You need an amplified speaker to connect your shure micro
1826,Does this come with a fingering chart?,yes :)
1827,"I have the MS-40, and I experience problems with the power / power button - after  a short time left speaker goes off line,","Yup, had the same exact problem. I thought it was the speaker to speaker cables, the Coax or Toslink cable and then my computers sound card but it wasn't. It drove me nuts. If it's still under warranty, send it back and have them fix it."
1828,"I didn't really understand the inputs on this mixer. So I have 3 electric guitars, and an electronic drum kit. Can all of these,with mic,be connected?",This mixer does not have sufficient mono channels for your application. Channels 2-3 and 4-5 are stereo inputs (meaning they are contolled with the same fader). Some of the larger Xenyx mixers will get you the inputs you need.... something with at least 5 distinct faders to control each instrument's mix individually.Hope this helps. :-)
1829,Any one Using this with FL Studio? Does it work with FL studio?,"Yes, it works perfectly with FL Studio, I'm using it myself with it"
1830,Is the power supply included?  And any issues with heat/overheating if used for long periods?  Thx!,"Yes, the power supply is included and we use it for longer period but there is no problem with overheating."
1831,will guitar support steel stings if I put on at a later time?,No. I would look for a guitar designed for steel strings.
1832,does it have the all the instruction books with it?,"When I purchased mine all the books were with it.  However, the a/c power source you have to purchase separately."
1833,Does this work for a Yamaha P Series P105B piano. And can you tell how much it weighs when boxed. Thanks.,"It can support the P105B as it is a standard stand.  It is adjustable too.  The length of the piano will clearly be longer than the stand, but the width will be perfect.  I have seen other stands paired with this digital piano and the fit seems the same.  My daughter uses this stand with her keyboard and we have had to adjust it only once.  It is very sturdy and I like the rubber stabilizing strips. Very well made.  As for weight, I don't quite remember.  The product had to be assembled so I would assume a few pounds heavier than the actual product.  Hope this help."
1834,I have an Epiphone DR-100 which measures 43x5x16 ... I am assuming it will not fit - am I correct?,"The D and DR model guitars are 'dreadnaughts', which is a standard size.  I've got a BlueRidge BD-16 dreadnaught in that case now, so there should be no problem as long as you get the 'DREAD' model bag."
1835,"Will these work if you keep your case standing up or on its side?  From the pictures, it looks like they expect you to keep it lying flat on its back.","No problem however the case is positioned.This is probably the best humidifier for guitars. Very simple, neat and clean, and also balanced. The only possible down side is that the replacement packs are relatively expensive, given that they only last two months or so (maybe slightly longer under certain conditions)."
1836,wwill a martin dx1 fit in this case?,"I bought mine to house a Seagull sws dreadnought and it fits beautifully. I think the Martin is very similar in size, however you can look up the specs on the Seagull to be sure. Good luck its a great case."
1837,Hi are these 110 y 220 V ??,110 v
1838,"i have short fingers, will i be able to play this guitar?",I have short fat fingers and it's my favorite guitar to play. I had a takamine that I disliked immensely because of the narrow fretboard. The short fingers should not make a big difference. Good luck.
1839,On baby taylor guitars can you purchase replacement strings?,Yes you can.  It takes the same strings as most guitars.

1841,"Anyone know of a wireless remote control that will work with this? I own this, but I can't find one listing as compatible with this unit.","The EF1000 relies on a different remote circuitry than the cheaper EF400 or any other cheap 400 watt fogger. Those you can buy the universal remote available at Party City. The EF1000's only option is the Chauvet, Eliminator or American Dj wired TIMER remote that has Interval, Duration, Timer, Continuous and Manual settings. You have to make sure the end of the remote has the 3 prong plug, some have the round type. Regardless they have the same circuitry and work with all 800 watt and up foggers."

Show Less","To hear the audio output of your Zoom H2, all you need is the cable with a stereo 1/8"" plug on one end and the stereo pair RCA (red/white) phone plugs on the other. Arista 18-3190 3.5 mm Male to 2 RCA Male CableThen you plug the RCA plugs into the line-in of your stereo system and play it through the system's speakers, which most households already have. I would start with the H2 playback volume set at its lowest setting and gradually increase it until you get an acceptable audio level. Since this output is strong enough to drive  earphones, it could blast your line-in input, if you don't start at a low level. You could also plug it into the stereo audio line-in connectors of your TV (which most have now) and just listen to the audio through the speakers with the set switched to AUX input (and a blank screen, of course). Use the red and white jacks only and ignore the yellow (video in) jack. If you have a high end TV, the speakers should be pretty good. In any case, high end or not, there should be no added noise. If you have an MP3 player jack in your ""modern new"" car, you can also listen through your car stereo. You will need a cable with 1/8"" stereo plugs on both ends for this. http://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Stereo-Male-Cable-ft/dp/B000GZ6ZQM/ref=acc_glance_ce_ai_-2_2_titIf you only have a cassette player in an older car, you can get one of those cassette adapters (about $10) and plug its own 1/8"" stereo plug into the H2 and listen through your car speakers. For examples:Walkman Car Connecting Pack for MD Walkman and CD Walkman (Model# CPA-9C)(side loading car cassette players only)Coby CA-747 Dual Position CD/MD/MP3 Cassette Adapter(can be switchable with a do-it-yourself rerouting of a cable for either front or side loading car cassette players)I have had great success with these types of adapters. The stereo high fidelity is amazing and it is very close to CD quality, even though you are going through a system made for tapes, which just shows how limited tapes were. The magnetic head-to-head contacts in the adapter convey nearly all the high frequencies that the H2 records. The frequency response of your car stereo system and speakers basically become the only limitation. If you have a high end car stereo system, the H2 will sound great! I've recorded live bands on the H2 and replayed them in my car this way and it genuinely recreated the live presence of the performance in the car with no unwanted noise. If you recorded in the MP3 mode with a large SD card, you would get many hours of your own personal pre-recorded ""driving"" music (or narration) this way. With 2500 MaHr rechargeable NiMH batteries, you can get 5 or 6 hours of continuous playback. Long enough for most car trips. So you have a whole slew of options here without having to run out and buy expensive amplifiers.BTW, this cassette trick may also work in a boom box, which has a cassette player but no line-in jacks. However, I can't guarantee that the boom box's simple mechanical sensors can be tricked into believing it's a regular tape and ""play"" the adapter. It does work extremely well in a car cassette player, though. My preferred way of playing back recorded files digitally, is to remove my SDHC 4 GB card from my H2 and put it in this USB Lexar card reader:Lexar Media Single-Slot USB 2.0 Multi-Card Reader (Model RW023-001)You can then play the files back using Windows media player and your PCs sound system. The software Audacity (hopefully still free) can be used for editing and has a wide range of editing tools.

1862,What if I want to sustain a note/chord for a minute or more? Is there a way to achieve this? What do I need? Thx.,"You should be able to keep the pedal down to sustain any note for an indefinite amount of time.  But note two things:  1) You can only achieve this with a tone that does not fade out (e.g., ""piano"" will fade out, but ""strings"" and ""pad"" won't fade out).  2) Keyboards have a limit on how many notes can be heard simultaneously.  I.e., if you try to sustain too many notes, the older notes will drop off as soon as you introduce new notes."

1872,"Hello I have an Egyptian made Mohammed el Arabi Sombati Drum. It's 9 inch, does this head fit it?","YES, this 9 inch head will fit the Sambaty 9 inch, Alexandrian style, aluminum doumbek"
1873,Can you manually control how the lights dim separate from sound response?,"You cannot control the dim, it is set up to go with the sound of the music you playing, but can control how slow or fast can dim or also you can change the dim which has I belive has four setup, for example one setup dim lights from center to either both side, other dim setup dim lights from right and left side to center, other one by one in sequence and then you can change the speed. The set is very good for the price, still you can buy a different set of dim for the four set of lights and go as you wish."
1874,Does this trumpet come with a case?,"Hey there, I purchased this for my son and can confirm that it DOES come with a case.  It's a hard black case with inside lining.  Purchased over a year ago and it has lasted on the school bus twice a day and being in lockers-and is still going strong :)  Hope this helped."
1875,"What is the Cone Diameter on this guitar? I might order a replacement from National, and upgrade the sound right away.","Hi from, Mike. It uses a standard 10 1/2"" Spider Cone - I did have to trim it a bit around the edge - Hope that helps - Mike."
1876,Ok last question on these before I make the order.  Do these speakers come with any wiring?  I own a MicroKorg with 1/4 inputs.,"No, only comes with the AC power cord.  You'll need some TRS cables to run your microkorg in, but that's it.  Livewire makes some good inexpensive cables.  These JBLs kick ass for the price, highly recommended!"
1877,What kind of case holds the reeds for a Bass Clarinet?,"This case will fit bass clarinet feeds, as well as regular clarinet reeds and saxophone reeds. This case will basically accommodate any size Reed from an Eb clarinet to a contrabass clarinet or Bari sax."
1878,will this work for a Magnavox Micromatic model 150927-2?,Works with any Audio Amplifier that has a Audio Input Source.  Hope this helps You. Larry Meadows
1879,"The picture shows a black case but the color is described as ""natural"". Please let me know if the case is black.",The one I got was black.
1880,does this unit have tremolo effect?,yes this is from digitech rp55 online manual : Tremolo (t1-t9)A Tremolo effect modulates the volume of the signal at an even rate. Use the Valuebuttons to select one of the nine predetermined settings.
1881,"SO, I bought this and I'm still not clear... do I need to buy beeswax for it? Or is it playable as is? IT just came today.","No this one comes with the mouth area shaped so you do not need beeswax to play it. Look on Youtube to see how to shape your mouth to breathe into it. It took my husband a few tries but when he got the hang of it, it sounded very nice. Low and mellow and it did help to calm him and with his Bell's Palsy. It is almost completely gone, except a tick around his mouth when he smiles for a long time. He only played occasionally."
1882,does it have a built in crossover?,I do not believe so. I was unable to get the crossover on the NU3000 I purchased to work and the sub would therefor would try to play full range sound. After much trouble with Behringer Tech Support I ended up returning both items. I love the two B215d's that I have though.
1883,"could somebody shout out the exact inside dimensions of this tenor case. I have fender tenor uke at 27.5 length, 9 at the bottom and 3.5 deep ?",Sounds about right...tenor uses are pretty standard in size.....unless it is a thin travel tenor ....like the kala
1884,The pouches and wheels look different in this picture than they do on the Kaces web page.  Are the two pouch compartments the same size or different?,"I bought ours in December of 2012. The two pouches are different sizes, The inner one is longer and has less depth. I insert the keyboard music stand in ours. It is a snug fit. The outer pouch is slightly shorter and is deeper. I put the sustain pedal, the power supply, and an extension cord in there.  We have not travelled much with this keyboard, just around Atlanta in a car. It has protected our Yamaha keyboard in good shape. The wheels are a great feature."
1885,is this a good choice for a small rehearsal studio?i plan to use 3 of them as floor monitors instead of pa system.,"I'd tell them yes, they should serve fine as floor monitor in a small space. Turned up loud they can be a bit noisy (hissing), but overall they do the job just fine. We use ours in a loud environment at high volume and it performs just fine."
1886,How many analog inputs this have? I dont understand how it says 16 ch in. i see in the picture less. Thanks in advance.,"8 analog inputs, plus another 8 digital inputs through ADAT.  It's a fine interface, I owned one for two years."
1887,Can it hook into an iPad and iPhone?,"No.  It can NOT directly connect to an iPhone.  The jacks are the same diameter and it will physically fit but but iPhones use a TRRS plug this mic has a ""normal"" TRS.  You can buy adaptors.  Ignore the comment here about ""XLR"".  This mic is not an XLR mic."
1888,I'm wondering about a warranty longer than 30 days? Is there a 1 year that may come standard with the instrument?,"Hello Mom H.,Thanks for the question through Amazon in regards to the warranty and return option for the Leblanc LB210 Bliss Bb Clarinet.  The 30 day timeframe is for the return option.  If you're not 100% satisfied with the instrument, you can return it to Taylor Music within 30 days for a full refund (this time of year we actually allow you until 1/31/14 to return for a full refund).

1889,Will this let you know when the batteries are running low? Does it have a way to mount to tripods or stands? And does it work for the Rode NTG3?,"It works great for any microphone needing phantom power which, i'm pretty sure includes the Rode NTG3. It does not however, run on batteries. It comes with it's own 18volt power supply but if you plan on using your mic for photography and need to move around, then you probably want something else. Good luck :-)"
1890,Does the microphone come with both the smaller and larger input devices?,Yea 1/4 in and 3.3 mm
1891,what gauge are these strings?,"The package reads light/medium and that's basically correct. Every string is consistently in-between a light gauge string and a medium gage  string (example: the G string light is .024 inch. the medium .026 and the Martin FX is .0255 inch). The benefit is one can have the tension/firmness feel of a medium gage yet the ability to bend the string with the ease of a light gage; it provides flexibility without sacrificing tone and string feel on a guitar with a smaller body (like a parlor size guitar in which a medium gage would be more the preference -  I haven't tried these strings on my dreadnaught size guitar in which I use different strings altogether). I'm quite happy with the result. Flexible Core makes sense to me.

1893,voice,"What about the ""voice""? :D"
1894,How does it record and where can you view the recording?,"Has to be connected to a computer or lap top via USB cable.  Computer has to remain on the entire time.  I would keep shopping if I were you.  I liked it at first, but keeping the computer on all day/night is an energy waste and suddenly the USB connection will not work.  Not happy with this product."
1895,what would be a good inexpensive windows XP application to use this mic with?,I have been using REW with this mic. The software is free from home theater shack and is a great tool to measure speakers and look at the measured acoustics of a room. Hope that helps
1896,"Buying for my wife's group fitness studio.  Is it best to use the XLR ouput or the 1/4"" output?  It would just be an instructor talking over music",The XLR is usually used when there is a long distance between the microphone  receiver and the amplifier.  I use the 1/4 inch when the receiver is nearby the mixer/amplifier.
1897,Are all the knobs on the same MIDI channel?,no. you can gave up to 4 separate midi layouts at one time by cycling with the program button. giving you a total of 32 knobs and pads.
1898,would you recommend this product over akai mpd26,The general consensus around various forums seems to be that the the Korg's pads are much more sensitive than the Akai's. I recenty purchased the PK and have no complaints; the pad sensitivity is indeed spot on.
1899,"have you tried using this product outside?  if so, did you have any problem with it?","I used it in a parade.  Two problems.  First, it will not work well in windy conditions. Second, the light is way too faint outside, unless in darkness.  This is really an inside decoration.  For a really good fire effect outside, use a Camp Chef portable fire ring Model GC-LOG-2.  Understand, that produces a REAL FIRE."
1900,Is the mic clip detachable?,"Yes it does. It is 3 pieces. Base, neck, and clip."
1901,will the dual cd player play burn cd off computer or a burn cd from another cd,"If it's a good burn.  As long as there's no problem with the CD-R, if it's an audio CD-R, it should read it."
1902,Would this be small enough for a carry on bag for flying?,"It depends on how long your bag is.    This is an amazing stand i.e. light, strong, great case, etc.; but it is long when folded up. Check the length with your luggage, and if it fits, you will be happy with this stand.   Another great feature is that it extends withoutcoming apart so if you stand for a solo, you just pull up and its set."
1903,will the harmonizer work without playing a guitar at the same time? will it work simply by singingthrough it?,"Just set it to Manual' and choose a key.  Everything you sing will be harmony parts in that key ONLY.  If you understand harmony (a little theory here...), then you will realize that certain notes in the scale will produce a 'fixed' harmony that might not be appropriate for the chord that you are singing over.  For example, if you choose Manual mode in the key of 'C' and an 'F Major' chord is sounding, and you sing a 'C' note, the harmony above (""High"" setting) will sound an E, making the resulting vocal 'chord' an F-Major-7th.  Playing guitar with the same situation NOT in manual mode will result in the harmony part above sounding the 'F' note, the correct harmony in context of the F chord.

1904,Can we stream karaoke tracks from the internet by connecting a laptop to it?,you are better off plugging your laptop into the sound board and doing it that way
1905,Would you recommended this for looping guitar in Ableton?,"Yes, it's quite easy to setup and you can do a bunch of cool things with it."
1906,how many bolt neck is this..basicily buy this.buy the right size neck and pickups.put it together..i looked in 60's don't have this finish,"Not sure I understand the question, but here is a data point or two.  The 70s Fender is a good rock/metal guitar as far as I am concerned.  It is not the best blues guitar.  For getting the blues sound I would go with the '54 or '57 Fender.  I like combining those two with a Vox or Fender Mustang.  Classic series 70s is the only Fender Stratocaster with that particular ""look"" (wood grain body and maple neck)"
1907,Is this compatible with windows 7?,"Yes it is, I have it installed on a windows 7    64 bit system"
1908,Is this a good choice for karaoke mixer? (I don't play musical instruments of DJ),"This mixer would work perfect for karaoke with the built in effects. However, it is going to be over kill with so many channels. It would give you room to grow. But, if you don't need the effects, I would recommend the Mackie Mix8. Much more compact. Mackie Mix Series Mix8 8-Channel Mixer"
1909,"I do not see a headpne plug.  My headset has attached boom, o e xlr plug and one jacj plug?",There is a headset output and volume control on the right side of the board.
1910,How will these stands work with a 1.5 inch speaker mount?,"Like the other two said, it's a 1 3/8' pole so it may be a little loose in a 1 1/2'.  It will work fine but if you want a snug fit you would need a adapter sleeve.  Overall it will work just fine!"
1911,does the microphone work only with batteries.,"I seriously do not remember, I was so disappointed when I received it. I was not really expecting much, it was a gag gift for Christmas but  It was a piece of junk and is sitting in my closet!"
1912,Can I use this cable directly from sound mixer out to video camcorder for audio capture?,"Yes, just make sure your camera is set to line in (as opposed to mic in) since your mixer will have its own gain controls. You should also be aware that even though this cable works well and is of good quality, movement of it during recording will likely result in audible noise, so if your camera is tripod mounted you'll be fine, but if you're using it handheld you may want to get an 1/8"" extension cable so the splitter is away from the movement."
1913,Would the screw on the end of this stand fit a cellphone clip mount made for a regular tripod? I want to make videos of myself drawing.,"No, the screw is a lot bigger, but you can buy tripod connectter to make it work. On Stage CM01 Video Camera/Digital Recorder Adapter"
1914,What speakers do you recommend to go with the wireless mikes?,That would depend on what size area you were trying to cover. But any quality speaker should do well with them.
1915,Will this work for the blue yeti?,"No, it will not!  I bought this mount for my yeti and it is FAR too small."
1916,Will it fit Fantom G-8 ?,should fit even the most oversized keyboards. it fit my kronos 88
1917,"I bought this and cant fit the clips for the condenser mics onto a standard mic stand (either 5/8 or 3/8). What am I missing? Edit: There is an insert that comes in the 5/8"" slot that is in too tight to remove by hand. Used a pliers and got it turning, but chewed up the plastic a bit.

1930,if my comcast business modem has SNR of 40 with downstream power level 10.5 and upstream level of 47 can amplifier help with signal drops?,"If your signal to noise ratio is above 29db then it's outstanding. If you have alot of noise on your line then the amp will amplify the noise as well as the signal. So in this case an amplifier is ok. Now your downstream power level leaves much to be desired. The closer to zero the better and at 10.5 your almost at the point where your modem can't hear the signal from the node. seeing that you have low noise on the line that tells me your coax lines are good and since your upstream db is 47 and within spec then the node can hear your modem just fine. So that tells me your drop from the pole is really long probably over 100 feet I'm guessing? In this case I would say yes this amplifier is an excellent solution to your problem, but I would stress that one you try to have a direct drop without splitters if possible because your cable tv could be the culprit here and second put the amplifier at the point of the coax entrance to your home for best performance. Good luck and I hope I helped.

1931,Can I use this to mic my classical guitar or do I need a stand with a boom?,"You could put this stand on something to get you to the appropriate height and as long as you have a condensing mic or standard that fits in the holder provided you're ok.It would be a fairly fixed position, which you can work with to record but overall a stand with more range, boom or flexed would give more flexibility."

1937,can it be used by a left handed drummer,"Yes, absolutely it can be used by a left handed drummer.  I am left handed but play with the traditional right-handed set up (snare and hi hat on left, ride cymbal and floor tom on right).  All of the pre-programed kits have this basic format.  However, you can create three custom kits, which would allow you to reverse this format, or make an entirely unique kit.  It is very flexible."

The BT-105 has two such stereo jacks allowing you to connect up to four total SPST NO switchpedals.  The BT-105 interfaces with your computer much as does a wireless keyboard limited to four keys.  The BT-105 emanates up to four different keystrokes from any one of five sets of keystrokes which you select by holding down one of the switchpedals while turning on power.  The default keyset (all switchpedals open on startup) is UpArrow, LeftArrow, DownArrow and RightArrow.

1942,Have been seeing this here for quite some time now - could the vendor PLEASE mention in the item description WHAT KEY the instrument is in?,"It says in the Product Detail section right above the Product Description section that it is key of C. However, this particular harmonica is sold by My Music Life and fulfilled by Amazon. Suzuki harmonicas are wonderful. I have three of them. However, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. My harmonica arrived dented and scratched and not in a box. It was loose in a padded envelop. I've purchased many harmonicas and all of them have had their own individual box and were sealed in a plastic sleeve. I contacted Suzuki and was informed that ALL of their harmonicas have boxes and this one is either used or a demo or from a boxed set that was broken up. Since it had so many scratches and a dent, I think it was used or a demo. I returned the product immediately.

1943,Is this a Mac version?,"It's for Mac and Winfows, Anthony."
1944,"Can you record your entire band @ 1 time several songs, and then burn you a demo CD?..","You can only record two tracks at a time, so a whole band will not be possible unless you record each member at a time. Check the DP-24 and DP-32 for 8 inputs, meaning you can record 8 tracks at a time."
1945,Can you plug this straight into a PA channel?   Looking to use it as a stomp box while I play acoustic guitar.,"It's just a trigger. You have to have something to process the signal such as a drum modual or ""brain,"" and then to some sort of amplification."
1946,Has anyone else had the issue where it just out of nowhere starts recording at like 1/10 the volume it should? Then it pops back to recording normally,I believe the problem to this is that your microphone is transmitting with auto-adjust. This means if you are to loud it turns down the voice and if your to quiet it turns it up. Somewhere in recording devices you can turn it off.
1947,How is the latency on this?  Is there a significant delay?,"Hey Jordan, the latency is low enough to record with other tracks. The driver is an asio type. I usually get less then 5ms. ;) there is also a mix knob to hear direct to monitor with 0ms latency or a mix through the computer with the asio."
1948,can i use it play effects and/or sample audio,"Good question. I do not use  for those things. I usually use Ableton Live  for playing effects and sampling audio live. If you map the controls by pressing the midi button you may assign that to the nanopad2. Ableton can sample live loops as you play them and you'd have to go into midi mode while the music is playing in order to route it to a trigger on the Korg. I'd have to check into effects. Maybe, to the XY controller. will let you know what I find."
1949,Will the Pioneer DDJ-SB Controller that is 19.2 fit?,"Yes it should fit. Interior of main compartment measures a little over 20""."
1950,where was this uke made thanks,The case and tuner instructions both say Indonesia
1951,"im thinkin of getting the sample pad pro to trigger sounds for my band ( we cover a lot of Floyd) Is this unit capable of this, saving the sounds?",Great question.  I believe it has the capability of loading and storing new sounds however we've never had the need since it comes with a ton of sounds and we just assign the ones we want to each individual pad/sensor.  I hope this helps.
1952,Will it work with OS X 10.6.8?,"It's compatible with many different OS & DAW's but my advice is to go to the Manufacturer's website & check with TASCAM themselves. They should be able to give you specifics on their product. If you get the runaround from them then try the Akai EIE or EIE/Pro Midi Interface. This interface is even better with an equal purchase price almost & will should work with your OS. But, just to be safe - check with Akai's website/manufacturer as well and of course with any other manufacturer before you make your final decision & purchase."
1953,Does it come with the stand?,Yes. Comes with a desk stand and an attachment to hold this onto a boom stand.
1954,"Does anyone know if the interior ""box"" (for picks, etc.) can be removed and moved higher up the neck? I want to use this case for a banjo mandolin.",Not unless you want to damage the case(Im sure not). Its molded in and you would have to cut the lining and foam...I would highly discourage chopping up this case....it is the case to have!
1955,Does this bundle include the Pro Tools 9 software??,Yes it does and then you are eligible to upgrade at no extra cost to Protools 10 or 11 through Avid.
1956,"in your opinion, would you consider this to be a gender specific design on a uke. im probably gonna buy it anyways, but i was just wondering","Nope, I would say it's pretty neutral. I've seen men with this ukulele and this dude was hella manly. And I got this uke and I'm a girl. But yeah, I would say its mostly neutral."
1957,Is it good for conference call in a room where the mic will be about 3-5 feet away from everyone?,I'd say it's better for a single person to use at once.
1958,"That Lauren Pera knucklehead review aside, does this foot switch work with Mustang III v2 amp? I had bought it for my Mustang III first version.","Yes, I use it with my Mustang III v2 amp.  It works great!"
1959,How many extension's can be added together?  3-4 5ft extension's.  This would be for the light bridge.,"3 pieces (15' total) is the maximum span the truss is rated per American DJ.  You could easily do 4 pieces if you were hanging very little weight, but I assume you would take full liability for any accidents."
1960,I'm new to guitars. Do you need an amp for it to work?,"Some electric guitars don't need an amp since some are built into them (have one and it works quite well). This one however does not have one built in so if you want to hear it correctly than yes, you need an amp. However you can play it without an amp but you won't get the great sound."
1961,"For those who have had this unit for over a year, is the mixer still working 100%? Does the mixer get really hot?","The mixer is still working great for me. I store it in my garage, and since I live in Arizona, the temp goes from close to freezing to blistering hot. Hasn't caused any issues yet. I haven't noticed the mixer getting really hot after usage but I only use it about once a week for around 3 hours. No issues at all other than I might be ready for a larger mixer now. Great 1st mixer for my 4-5 piece band."
1962,Will this cable send audio to the usb of my laptop?,"According to their website, yes.  However, I am not sure about the wiring of the 3 pin XLR.  It could be wired as ""balanced audio"" or as ""unbalanced audio"".  Balanced audio puts the sound on pins 2 and 3 with 1 being a ground.  Unbalanced is usually using only 2 wires, so it might be any combination of and 2 wires.  A little experimentation should provide results.  In my case, I was using balanced audio and it worked just fine."
1963,"Does this case give good protection for the instrument?  My 6th grader will be traveling back and forth to school, and she's not the most careful.",Yes. I bought it for my 7th grader and he hasn't had any issues. He also likes that he can carry this case like a back pack.
1964,"I have a bc rich kerry king ""v"" guitar. Will this stand hold a v without the points of the v hitting the ground?","Probably not.  Also, the way a V would sit in the base, I don't think it would be able to lean towards the neck supports.  I have an Explorer and it doesn't really fit in the stand either, so I keep it on separate a neck-hanging stand."
1965,Can you confirm these units are 110v/240v AC auto voltage switching ?,"Yes , they support both. I've got them and use them in germany with 230V"
1966,"If this is a 4/4 case, why does my 4/4 bow not fit in the bow compartment?  My 4/4 bow is too long.  My violin fits fine.","My standard 4/4 violin bows (29"") fits perfectly. Maybe something at the tip end has been accidentally stuffed or blocking your bow from fitting. If your bow is much longer than 29"" it will not fit."
1967,is it a high quality,"Yes, it is high quality. It has a sweet sound."
1968,Can I Connect 4 lavalier Wireless Mics on this item and I can connect a couple of Speakers to this mixer?,"You can connect anything that has 1/4"" plugs, RCA plugs and XLR plugs. So if your mics and speakers have those kinds of cables, you can connect them to the mixer. If not, you can also find adapters. For example you may need a 3.5mm to  1/4"" adapter, or a 1/4"" adapter to XLR. Whatever combination you may need is probably findable on Amazon."
1969,Which is the freq of this System??? I just want to know to buy more receivers that works in the same freq that this transmitter!!! thanks!,"This is the K1 frequency if purchased from Moore Brothers Music. I cannot guarantee that from other sellers. By the way, we do have other frequencies available as well so let us know what your needs are if other than K1."
1970,"Steel or nylon strings ? Hi,I would like to know if the guitar is steel or nylon strings.Thanks,",steel
1971,what about window 8 is it ok,I use this product with windows 8 and I don't have any problems
1972,What is the warranty on this item,One year parts and labor. Which is real good as most others only do 90 days on these type electronics. For the price this is a very good machine. The company is solid as well. They stand behind their products.
1973,Would a 22x20 bass drum fit (size not including rims)?,Yes
1974,"Where do you clip on the tuner on the ukulele? Also, can't really understand how to tune it. Would love some help.","You clip the tuner on the end head stock where the tuning pegs are. Turn the display face towards you sou can see the tuning display. The best place that I found for tuning a ukulele is on ""You Tube"". There are some really excellent sights. I hope this helps you."
1975,Is the volume adjustable?,yes it is.  it's a really nice little metronome!
1976,Has anyone tried this using a 30 pin to lightning converter for use on the new devices?,"Yes, it works but then you almost have to buy the rig hd for your audio. If your doing a gig you end up with a lot of wire clutter and worry more about engineering instead of artistry. Ik is a good product but I might suggest making the investment to upgrade..yes I did."
1977,Is the connecting cable between I-MX1 and the iPad included ?,Yes
1978,"Thanks foe the answer, My guitar (yamaha fg 730S) has a Scale Length of 25.56""...so will it fit?","I have a Yamaha guitar, no sure about the size, but is big. The guitar fit with a little of effort. The main complain I have is that it's very unconfortable to carry on my back. The straps are bad located (I hate them). Hope this helps you, Thanks."
1979,Is it an electric acoustic which can be plugged into an amp with a cable?,"Yes, you plug it in to an amp with a cable. It requires a 9 volt battery in the guitar to work. I recommend this guitar for a beginner/kid to see if they are interested. You will need to buy a good tuner to make sure its in tune before playing each time. If you have any serious interest in guitar, spend the money on a decent guitar or you will just get frustrated as its harder to play on a less expensive guitar. - reviewed by Luciana's husband.."
1980,dose it come with HI Hat pedal<<<<,"Yes, the hi-hat pedal trigger is included with the kit.  The only things you don't get that you would need to play are a kick pedal, a throne, and sticks."
1981,Do you need to add speakers to this?,"Yes. The least you would need would be self powered speakers that the 1/4"" out attaches to."
1982,Does this unit come with AC power or does it run only on batteries?,AC power and a flux capacitor
1983,"Does it come with a cable to plug it into a guitar, or should I buy one separately?",Buy a cable bro
1984,ipad,No this is not an iPad
1985,Is this nylon strings or steel? I don't see that anywhere. I want steel.,The strings I received were steel.
1986,Is it for 11 year olds,It is just like a real trombone just not as expensive. But it's not a toy. It's a real instrument
1987,Is it  compatible with Windows 8 or do i have to download some extra software to be able to use it?,I use it with windows 8... Just plug and play with included software.
1988,where is this banjo made,"It's labeled as being made in China . Being an experienced guitar player I was excited to try out the banjo and thought to begin with this price was fine . It looked good enough.Turns out I was wrong very very cheaply made, strings broke with the first tuning and most of the screw and fastenings with either loose or broken .... I do not recomend"
1989,I have a Sony DCR-SR65.  Does anyone know if this will work that my camera?,"I haven't used it directly with that camera, but if your camera has an 1/8"" (3.5mm) mic input or an XLR input it should work. (just make sure if you are using the 1/8"" input you pay attention to the direction written on the cable, as it does make a difference.)"
1990,I have an irritating pipe in my wall that is always rattling. Can these be used on my wall for the purpose of effectively blocking that kind of sound?,No wrong frequency
1991,"For an outdoor party with electro / bassy music and 75 people, would two of these be considerably better than one? No woofer an issue? Thanks.",this works great for those types of events.  if you are trying to please the hard party people get two otherwise one is enough.
1992,"The description says it comes with two booklets, instruction and Zelda, but I only see one book pictured.  Does it come with two?","Hi There, the contents of the case was the ocarina itself, a songbook with some tunes and a form with a link (no pun intended) to a page which has two wonderful booklets. Hope solve your issue. Cheers...Fabio"
1993,Can you confirm Romanji is supported?,Yes this product is Romaji Supported.
1994,"I am trying to decide between the THR10 and the THR10x.  I play mostly late-80s type stuff, with some classic rock thrown in.  Which would be better?",The original is more versatile in my book...stays in my truck to jam out at a moments notice.
1995,Is there any adapter to use this with the newer iphone with the smaller pins. Has anyone used it with the Iphone5,I'm not aware of one for the lightening adaptor yet.   I use it with my iPad3. You should be ok with a standard to lightening adaptor. You can also email the company; they're very helpful!
1996,How can I hook it up to a sound system ( amp or PA system ) for instance for live performance ?,You'll need to have a laptop to operate the mpc studio.. Then just run a stereo breakout cable from the laptop to the pa system. Just use a 3.5mm with aux cords at the end (red & white). Your problem should be solved :-)
1997,Can this be powered by plugging directly into the wall?,With this product you receive a charger and you can plug it directly on the wall.
1998,can i add a microphone?,"Yes, it has to be the same kind tho. There is 2 slots, so you can have up to 2"
1999,Can you use the microphone and the instrument pack at the same time or only separate times?,Same time. They run at different frequencies.
2000,Home theater. Laptop server wired (CAT5) and wireless. HDMI to reciever. Is Roku just pass-through for stereo? Still digital? - ? the Cambridge,I use mine strictly for my high resolution audio all onboard sound boards have to be disabled in order to get the full capability of a DAC when used with a 5.1 home theater it's nothing but a brick the HT head unit will mess with the bit stream and the DAC will do it's best but you're feeding it 50% of the dataA DACs place in my setup goes like thisLaptop usb out DAC high quality RCA plugs to AMP to speakersthe fewer steps between the source audio and the DAC the betterhope that helps
2001,"So the 2 provided mics can be used simultaneously because of the dual channel, but can a 3rd wired mic be used also when plugged into the 6.5mic jack?","Absolutely. And a fourth. One of the plugins must be a ""dynamic"" mike (upper, 1/4-inch or 6.5-mm jack) and the other must be a ""ceramic"" mike (second, 1/8-inch or 3.5-mm jack). Plus you can add MP3 music via the third ""aux in"" jack. You can even add several more mikes using a ""sub-mixer"" through this ""aux in"" jack."
2002,"Is this made in Indonesia or China? Also, are the tuners white or black?",It has black tuners. Made in China. We have it available.
2003,i wanna know if i can upgrade to pro tools 9 with it ?,mine came with pro tools 9 and they Avid offered me to upgrade to 10 the very next day
2004,How do you tell which string is which.  The outside of the package says they are color coded.  Inside they are all in the same package with no color.,"On the back of the envelope it list each string with a color. Each inside envelope has a ""colored dot"" that corresponds to the letter of the string."
2005,How can I get more/ extra microphones for G 522 H?,If you are asking about adding extra mic to the same receiver then my reply you can not. This unit is only good for 2 channels.
2006,How is it delivered? Does someone come and install it in the home or is it just a box left at the door and you need to put it together?,"My delivery was ""threshold"" only.  They would get it into the house, but from there it was your responsibility.  It was a large box and quite heavy.  You are required to assemble it by putting the legs and back on and putting together the bench.  It wasn't hard, but I had my wife help lift the piano body onto the stand once it was assembled just to be safe."
2007,Will this work with the Surface Pro 3,No
2008,Is it possible to change the shock mount? I have a samson Shock mount for my Audio technica 2500?,"Yes, it is. The included shock mount is removable allowing you to add your own."
2009,I am debating between the Audio Tecnica lp120 vs lp1240. Do you guys have any thoughts. I am a wedding Dj and I CLub Dj sometimes.,I own both (in fact I have Two LP 1240's and one LP 120) Get the LP1240.  It's a much better record player.  It's Heavier thus less feedback at loud volumes.  It has standard RCA outputs rather then a fixed RCA cord which you can't easily replace if broken.  It's more expensive but we'll worth it.  Both are solid though.  Hope that helps.  Lars
2010,"When it sits in the shockmount, it seems to bobble...is there a way to stabilize it?","It is supposed to ""bobble"" a bit... That's the whole point of the shockmount.  The more stiffly the mic is held, the more noise is transmitted to it as a result of physical motion (such as moving items on the table where the mic is sitting, or walking near the mic, etc.). The flexibility of the mount allows these vibrations to dissipate.  It IS possible for the elastic to be too loose (especially with age)... But as a general rule, the flexibility in the system is good."
2011,Do it comes with a gig bag or hard case?,It did not come with a bag or case of any kind.
2012,"Do these produce the same color light as your ""HitLights Cool White(6000K) 600 LEDs (Double Density) Flexible Light Strip"" product? Which is brighter?",I have no experience with the double density strips but the hitlights web site says the color temp for both is 6000K so I would expect the to be very close in color. The 300 ct ribbon uses smd5050 led which are brighter than the smd3528 leds on the 600 ct ribbon. I have no way to compare the brightness of the 300 ct vs 600 ct ribbons.
2013,Has anyone tried this with portable recorders such as the Zoom H4n? Does it work well?,Yes.  I've used it well with my portable Tascam stereo recorder.  It blocks out unwanted sound effectively.
2014,"Can I switch the controller to use use this one, which has 133 light effects (like chasing light) and shows more than one color at a time?",The string of lights is a dumb string of lights. The string will only display one color at a time. The controller will work but with limited function. Not what you want.
2015,I was hoping to link 3 or 4 together. Will have them powered with the Intermatic ML200RT 200 Watt Low Voltage Lighting Transformer. Possible?,"If the details about this item are correct the ""Power consumption is 24W"" - so a 200 watt transformer should be more than what you need. I have 3 strings connected to a 150watt transformer, with no heat issues or tripping."
2016,How many tracks can you record to with this software?,Unlimited Audio and Midi tracks! Your hardware/equipment is the only limitation. Latency. I/O. Etc.
2017,does it come with an ac power adapter to plug into a wall socket?,Yes.
2018,Can you connect this to computer with usb port?,"There is a special USB port for the keyboard. USB 2.0 Type B plug on one end and the regular USB on the other for your computer, which does not come with the keyboard. Hope that helps."
2019,"I have KRK Rokit G2 8 inches, Should I order a Medium or Large?",Large. IsoAcoustics actually provides a chart pairing a vast number of studio monitors to their recommended model:  http://www.isoacoustics.com/files/chart_imperial.pdf
2020,I can use this drum whith a double bass pedal ?,Yes
2021,ok so im ordering new heads for this drum set would a 22 inch bass drum head fit this bass drum,"Yes it would, I have the same set."
2022,"Hello, I have the original Floyd Rose and need some parts.(Jackson guitar), is this all metal? Same than the images shown? Thanks","I don't recommend this part if you have the original floyd rose, Quality is bad, unable to keep your guitar tune.. I took advantage of a recent trip to U.S and bought a decent one... ( $140 ) so don't waste your time and money"
2023,"Thanks, Fatpicker, I am asking if the radius is 7 1/2"", 12"", 14, or specifically what the specific radius of that neck is.  Thanks once more.","Obtained gage from bassist friend- radius appears to be 14"". He found gage at TuneMyBass.com. RF"
2024,Does this one (QX1202 USB) has reverb/echo control on each mic input lines?,Yes
2025,Do the keys light up at all if you are using the media disc on the computer?,No
2026,Does this controller work with an iPad?,Yes
2027,"Can I record a tune with it say a base line, and then play on top of that and record that as well, and keep adding layers.","Yes, you can record 5 melody tracks and a 6th accompaniment track. (Someone told me you can record a 6th melody track instead of an accompaniment, but if so I haven't been able to figure out how.) So you can record the bass line on one track, then record another part on another track, etc. As you record each new track, the tracks you've already recorded will play so you can play along in time with the parts you've already recorded.I've only just started playing around with the recording features myself, so I haven't figured everything out yet. But you can play up to 3 voices at once-- the Main Voice, an optional Dual Voice (which plays at the same time as the Main Voice to create a two-layer sound), and an optional Split Voice (which plays in the left-hand side of the keyboard).First of all, you cannot record the Split Voice, so don't even try-- what you should do is set the Main Voice to whatever you want to use for the bass part and record it separately as its own track. Note that you can play as many keys as you want for each part, although the keyboard has a maximum limit of 32-note polyphony-- so you can play more than just a bass line, you can play chords and such, but don't go overboard on the number of simultaneous notes in each part or you might very well exceed the 32-note polyphony limit.Furthermore, you can record the Main Voice and Dual Voice on a single track-- they'll be recorded as a single ""track"" but will actually be split into two separate MIDI channels. However, only the first three tracks can record the Dual Voice-- if you try to record a Main/Dual Voice combination to tracks 4 and 5, they'll seem to play back okay on the keyboard, but only the Main Voice will actually be written to the MIDI file.So you'll want to plan your parts accordingly: use tracks 1, 2, and 3 for recording any two-layered voices (Main/Dual Voice combinations) you want to use-- which includes voices like ""Octave Piano"" that are actually made up of a Main Voice and Dual Voice-- and use tracks 4 and 5 for recording one-layer voices (Main Voice). As for track 6/A, use it for recording any auto-accompaniment you want to use-- it will actually record all the different parts of the accompaniment, splitting them up into (I think) up to eight different MIDI channels.From what I've seen-- although I might be wrong-- the ""tracks"" on the PSR-E433 will be saved to the following MIDI channels:Track 1 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 0 and (if applicable) the Dual Voice is saved to MIDI channel 5.Track 2 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 1 and (if applicable) the Dual Voice is saved to MIDI channel 6.Track 3 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 2 and (if applicable) the Dual Voice is saved to MIDI channel 7.Track 4 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 3; any Dual Voice used for Track 4 will not be saved to MIDI.Track 5 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 4; any Dual Voice used for Track 5 will not be saved to MIDI.Track 6/A -- The Auto-Accompaniment parts will be saved to MIDI channels 8 through 15, depending on the Auto-Accompaniment.Of course, once you've recorded a song on the PSR-E433, saved it to MIDI, and transferred it to a computer, you can use a DAW or other MIDI editor to slice and dice it however you wish. Or you can create a 16-track MIDI file in a DAW, then load and play it on the PSR-E433 just fine.By the way, just to be accurate-- the recorded song will be written to a type-0 MIDI file, or all 16 channels in the same MIDI track. But a DAW should display each channel as a separate ""track"" anyway, so it doesn't really matter that it's a type-0 MIDI file.On the other hand, the PSR-E433 can play either type-0 or type-1 MIDI files, so you can separate the different MIDI channels into their own MIDI tracks if you want.



    Yes, you can record 5 melody tracks and a 6th accompaniment track.

   Yes, you can record 5 melody tracks and a 6th accompaniment track. (Someone told me you can record a 6th melody track instead of an accompaniment, but if so I haven't been able to figure out how.) So you can record the bass line on one track, then record another part on another track, etc. As you record each new track, the tracks you've already recorded will play so you can play along in time with the parts you've already recorded.I've only just started playing around with the recording features myself, so I haven't figured everything out yet. But you can play up to 3 voices at once-- the Main Voice, an optional Dual Voice (which plays at the same time as the Main Voice to create a two-layer sound), and an optional Split Voice (which plays in the left-hand side of the keyboard).First of all, you cannot record the Split Voice, so don't even try-- what you should do is set the Main Voice to whatever you want to use for the bass part and record it separately as its own track. Note that you can play as many keys as you want for each part, although the keyboard has a maximum limit of 32-note polyphony-- so you can play more than just a bass line, you can play chords and such, but don't go overboard on the number of simultaneous notes in each part or you might very well exceed the 32-note polyphony limit.Furthermore, you can record the Main Voice and Dual Voice on a single track-- they'll be recorded as a single ""track"" but will actually be split into two separate MIDI channels. However, only the first three tracks can record the Dual Voice-- if you try to record a Main/Dual Voice combination to tracks 4 and 5, they'll seem to play back okay on the keyboard, but only the Main Voice will actually be written to the MIDI file.So you'll want to plan your parts accordingly: use tracks 1, 2, and 3 for recording any two-layered voices (Main/Dual Voice combinations) you want to use-- which includes voices like ""Octave Piano"" that are actually made up of a Main Voice and Dual Voice-- and use tracks 4 and 5 for recording one-layer voices (Main Voice). As for track 6/A, use it for recording any auto-accompaniment you want to use-- it will actually record all the different parts of the accompaniment, splitting them up into (I think) up to eight different MIDI channels.From what I've seen-- although I might be wrong-- the ""tracks"" on the PSR-E433 will be saved to the following MIDI channels:Track 1 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 0 and (if applicable) the Dual Voice is saved to MIDI channel 5.Track 2 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 1 and (if applicable) the Dual Voice is saved to MIDI channel 6.Track 3 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 2 and (if applicable) the Dual Voice is saved to MIDI channel 7.Track 4 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 3; any Dual Voice used for Track 4 will not be saved to MIDI.Track 5 -- The Main Voice is saved to MIDI channel 4; any Dual Voice used for Track 5 will not be saved to MIDI.Track 6/A -- The Auto-Accompaniment parts will be saved to MIDI channels 8 through 15, depending on the Auto-Accompaniment.Of course, once you've recorded a song on the PSR-E433, saved it to MIDI, and transferred it to a computer, you can use a DAW or other MIDI editor to slice and dice it however you wish. Or you can create a 16-track MIDI file in a DAW, then load and play it on the PSR-E433 just fine.By the way, just to be accurate-- the recorded song will be written to a type-0 MIDI file, or all 16 channels in the same MIDI track. But a DAW should display each channel as a separate ""track"" anyway, so it doesn't really matter that it's a type-0 MIDI file.On the other hand, the PSR-E433 can play either type-0 or type-1 MIDI files, so you can separate the different MIDI channels into their own MIDI tracks if you want.

2046,can i output directly from an audio mixer to this device then to computers usb?,"It'll take any analog audio signal in XLR form and convert it to digital (that's why it's bulky around the USB connector part).

2068,How is the action on this guitar?,String height at fret 12 is (3.4)/32 inch.
2069,Are the silicone rubber pads safe for the nitrocellulose finish on my Gibson Les Paul electric guitar?,"You will need to check with the manufacturer and ask if the silicone rubber pads contain any plasticizing compounds. Plasticizing compounds can cause the nitrocellulose finish of a guitar (or other object) to soften, discolor and/or deteriorate.  Note that plasticizing compounds could be in vinyl, rubber, or plastics which could include guitar straps, picks, capos or other objects with vinyl, rubber, or plastics in them."

The material is _very_ stretchy Lycra, it should cover a DGX nicely.  Gator gives suggested dimensions -- compare them to Yamaha's dimensions for the DGX to be sure."
2075,Can the os-2 pedal also be used with a bass guitar,"I've got two basses (both 4-string, one in E and one in D) I run through the pedal frequently. I haven't encountered any problems with it."
2076,what size pipe does this clamp fit?,1inch; 1-1/2inch and a 2inch pipes.

2078,Is there a headphone out socket?,"In the back of the unit is a 1/4"" Preamp output"
2079,Is it measuring RMS or Peak?,"It depends - (I hate it when someone says that; bear with me.)  The meter features a gain control for each channel.  That said, you are asking about ""rise time"" or the needle ballistics for mechanical meters.  This factor is relevant in understanding why not all meters seem to respond in the same way.  First, set up a test tone on your audio console/mixer/source and calibrate its local meter to -12dB, the digital standard, or 0VU, the analog standard.  Set the input levels to any recorders connected to your mixer in the same way.  Set your AmAudio Meters to just illuminate the -12dB red LED.  Now you have everything calibrated for ""static gain"".  This is step one in managing your studio's ""gain plan"".  Now, play some pulsing music or just ""pip"" the tone on/off to analyze the ballistics behaviors of all your meters and learn about the differences in rise/response times.  Meters with zero response time are peak readers.  Example:  A hard single piano note can have a 10dB difference between RMS and peak readings.  Normal speech ""envelope"" has roughly 1.5 to 2dB of difference.  Hope this is all helpful.

I understand the ear is your best friend when tuning ,but to get your exact tension measurement I thought it would be cool .I'm just not sure","I've been playing for a few years, by no means an expert, but I've been very happy with the Drum Dial. It helps me get to the right tone and sustain (for me this is tricker to get where I want) faster, and more consistently each time I tune."
2082,Will this case be a good fit for my prs Se 245,"Hello, I wish I could be more help to you. I have a Gibson Melody Maker 2014 that is a bit too thin for this case. I had to pad it out with some hand towels to make it fit properly. If your guitar is thinner than a regular Les Paul, you might have to do the same type of thing to make yours fit in terms of depth. Otherwise, it fits the other dimensions pretty well."
2083,Will this work on an Epiphone Les Paul 100?,"I have that exact guitar. I had to do some serious modification to get my guitar to fit. It involved pulling back the fabric lining and chipping away at the wood underneath. I would have to recommend a different case since the pressure on the neck of a guitar due to a case that is too small, may effect the integrity of the instrument. I have had tuning issues with mine, but I'm not sure of the cause of this."

The 231 is a great eq, and this one that we're selling used works perfectly.  The difference between the 231 and 231s is mostly cosmetic.  We've compared them sonically and can't hear a difference.

   I bought my granddaughter the First Act Discovery Acoustic Sunburst Guitar?  Not sure what size it is or if its a 3/4 size guitar does anyone know if this will fit in the this World Tour 3/4"" padded bag?
      « 

Show Less","This case will work for a guitar that is 3/4 or smaller. It won't work for a full size guitar. If you do not know the size of the guitar you purchased, you could get a full size case because a 3/4 size will fit in a full size case."
2115,are they hard plastic?,Yes
2116,Can another mic be used be sides the one it comes with?,"Yes but the first thing to understand is that the inputs are 1/4 mono phone (not phono) high impedance jacks.  Most consumer and some specialized professional mics feature a 1/8"" Phone plug, so you would need to obtain an adapter. A stereo one will work fine, because the center pole is simply common or not used in tis type of input.  See Hosa MHE310 Female TRS 1/8-Inch to Male TRS 1/4-Inch Headphone Adapter Cable, 10-FeetNow, some older, semi-pro Mics by Sure, AV, etc.(and many new cheap consumer Mics for Karaoke machines, etc.), come ready to go, with a 1/4"" plug or 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter included.  See Audio-Technica ATR-1100 Unidirectional Dynamic Vocal/Instrument MicrophoneBut, you can also use a professional low impedance Mic, such as a Sure SM58, which has an 3pin XLR connector, but you will need an impedance adapter.  See CP8201 Microphone Impedance Matching TransformerFinally, with an external mixer, you could use any number of mics, or outside sends and sources from keybards and guitars, to stereo systems and more, including other higher end UHF and Digital wireless systems, which is what I do!  You just to match the impedance and connections.

2117,"I am looking for a foot pedal to control a hardware synthesizer via MIDI during live performance, how sturdy is this unit for touring?","I've had mine for almost a year, and I use it a lot and take it back and forth to practices and shows.  Nothing's broken and everything's still working.  Though obviously I wouldn't recommending throwing it on the ground or anything.  I always transport it using the box and Styrofoam supports that it came in, just to be safe."
2118,Is there a CD player that is compatable with this system??,"Pretty much any CD player that has a 'line out' jack you can connect to this unit. I have never had the need to connect a CD player - yet - but there isn't any certain brand, just has to have the line out and connect to the unit 'line in'. I am very pleased with my unit."
2119,does this unit need to be plugged into a separate amp and mixer or is it stand-alone?,"Yes, this unit needs to be plugged into a separate amp or mixer. It cannot stand alone."
2120,"What are the inside dimensions of the extra pockets?  I'm looking for something to fit my keyboard, plus a thick 15.6"" laptop, plus some snacks... :)","there are no inside pockets but the two outside pockets measure 16"" x 12""."
2121,How wide are legs at bottom at shortest setting of table top?,Approximately 14.5 inches by 47 inches. That's from the outside of the legs.
2122,What is the different on H7 K7 M7?,The different models are on different bands. They are basically the same microphone otherwise.
2123,does this come with a/c power?,"Yes.  Mine included an AC cord and seems to work fine.  I did notice on a couple of the pots that you should turn down the volume while adjusting as it sometimes gives a rather loud pop that can be very loud in headphones but once you have it stable at the level of choice, the mixer works great.  Good solution at low cost for a small studio."
2124,what functionality does this add to the jamman solo?,"Among other things, it allows you to undo your last recorded action (this is the big one), or reverse the track using your foot. It's really handy. Wouldn't recommend going without it."
2125,24bit?,"16 Bit, 48000Hz is where it maxes out.  Perfect for playing 320 Kbps mp3's."
2126,Does this thing have any sort of carry handle or strap?,"Hello! No, also it does not provide any attach for do so... Its a food device, but it will be possible to use a screwdriver to open it and fix the little enceintes, but theres no a problem! I fix mine in less than five minutes! There is no too much distorsion, works good on clean. Its for practice and maybe little rush with friends or jammings inside a room."
2127,will this work with the blue spark digital mic?,"YES! I'm so excited that it does work, a cheaper alternative to Blue's $100 option. I bought the blue spark digital about two months ago and I have been having an issue with picking up my keyboard and mouse clicks, now that I have this mount, I can put it on a stand!"
2128,"Hi I have a Kawai ES100, and currently have an X stand but need another one - if I used my Kawai on this stand, does it ""sit"" on pads? Will this work?","My keyboard ""sits"" on pads and stays securely without being attached in any way.  I like the sturdiness and adjustability of this stand better than the X type."
2129,"Do you need to purchase a separate amplifier for these?  Also, can the connect right to a lap top?",Yes you will need a separate amp.  No these do not connect directly to a computer.
2130,Can I prop a guitar with a Gig bag on it?,"If you are thinking while the guitar is in the bag to keep if from collecting dust, only if the bag is less than 3 inches thick.  The measurement inside the bottom front bracket and back bracket the guitar leans on is just under 3 inches."
2131,I see that Roland makes a stand for it for $80. but heard a generic mic stand will also work? Anyone have an example they know works?,The Roland CM-30 has a standard mic thread on the bottom - you can just screw it on a regular mic stand. I would make sure it is a sturdy mic stand with a tripod or large weighted base.
2132,Can the width be adjusted (fold it halfway)?  It's for my NS / Stick.,"i just tried it, and yes you can. it is a very sturdy stand."
2133,Won't work on Mac w/ OS X 10.7.5 & GarageBand 11. Orange light comes on signaling USB connection. Edited preferences in GB properly. What do I do?,I have a Mac with GarageBand 11 and I got it to work. Make sure you plug in the device BEFORE opening GarageBand. Then in GarageBand go to preferences and change the audio input to the correct USB. Also if you turn on Track Monitoring you can hear your guitar with all the effects coming from GarageBand as you play. Hope this helps!
2134,it's only one monitor studio?,Sold as a single monitor
2135,how do you put a strap on this guitar,Ah...Here is a link to illustrate what I am referring to :)Performance Plus GS1300 Leather Classical Guitar or Ukulele Strap with Leather Neck BandThank you!
2136,Do you guys think this would hold up on an international flight?,"I would add extra padding on top and bottom, perhaps bubble wrap. I would assume other things would be stacked on this, assuming it lays flat."
2137,What kind of more affordable speakers would work with this?,I have this keyboard and use a Roland CM-30 Cube Monitor with it. The Cube monitor works extremely well and has a very clean and unfiltered sound (which was important for me since I play mostly classical piano). It's also great since it's actually a mini PA with 3 inputs and a preamp for use with mics and other instruments.
2138,Are they good as near-field studio monitors for home studio? Do they work with Denon DRA 500ae receiver?,"I have a recording studio in my home and have been playing and engineering music recordings for 30 years.   I bought these as computer monitors in my office - but I sometimes use them to proof a mix.  They are nice as an ""alternative"" to my studio monitors.  In my studio I use Mackie HR-824's, Yamaha NS-10's and a pair of Klipsch Heresies to get different ""looks"" at a mix.   The Control 1 has weak/non existent low bass response, so it's not useful as a primary studio monitor.  I also find them to be less than flat through the mid-range.  So a mix that sounds good on them, can sound ""midgange heavy"" when you listen to it in the car or any system with a nominally boosted midrange.  So I would say, they are NOT very good if you are a serious audiophile or sound engineer and you want to use them as your sole or primary monitors.   Where they are good is for mixing a nice punchy bass response(80-200hZ).  As a result, I use them to mix drums and bass all the time.  If those instruments sound good on these speakers, they will sound GREAT on a high fidelity system.  Sometimes, when you mix drums and bass on small speakers, the mix ends up being really boomy and bass heavy once you have subwoofers and full frequency playback.  Not so in this case.  They have a very controlled bass response.   Maybe that's why they are named ""control""?  So, if you want another set of speakers to check a mix, or if you are doing a lot of drum and bass music, they might be OK.

2139,noise,i can confirm that these headphones make noise
2140,Is the only receiver output to an amp? What if I want to play over my home stereo? Or if I want to go directly to a bluetooth speaker?,"I know I use mine through my PA system also,  I do not know about the stereo unless there is a port which will take it."
2141,"I ran a search for ""youth guitars"" and this came up; however, it's not described as a youth model. Is it full-sized or not?","It is the full sized for a adult or young teenager,I am 19 and its in good size,if you are looking for someone younger. than 13 this guitar is not for them. Hope this helps!"
2142,Does this support multi-track recording? 8 inputs/8 seperate tracks?,"Yes, you can record 8 discrete tracks simultaneously via XLR or 1/4"" inputs."
2143,Where was this made?,"I have no idea, do not recall or cared.  However very good quality and pleased ...   5Stars"
2144,Is this height adjustable?,no.  and it doesn't have an opening lid either.
2145,Would this make the guitar a lot quieter for practicing? Or is it just for preventing feedback when amplified?,Some what quieter. I always remove mine when back to not being amped. Be mindful to buy the correct hole size.
2146,Can anyone tell me how long this would last with a battery?,"Also, when you unscrew the back, you will have to CAREFULLY, slide your modulation controls to the side, and underneath, the battery bay is located. I have read that with this thing on your chain, on or off, it will suck battery power, and the efx will therefore change over time vs the direct route."
2147,will this work for vocals. looking for something cheap want my daughter to her her voice different to get her more interested,"I have plugged in a guitar and vocal mic to get that old 1950's reverb effect and it worked quite nicely.  I also sang vocal notes into it trying out various settings and found it produces numerous effects.  I do find that it seems more reponsive to guitar than voice, but then I've only been using it for a week.  I strongly suggest, however, that your daughter spend more time practicing voice without the unit than with...this toy is tons of fun, but might aid in developing some bad vocal habits.  I find I could easily use it as a crutch to aid lazy singing (reverb can make you think you're sounding better than you are).  I find that when I use it, I tend to ""slide into"" my notes, rather than attacking them accurately.  But other than that, I have found this little blue Behringer to be an excellent value for the money.

2148,Do I have to plug the machine into en amp? My hammon organ feeds directly into the leslie.,"Unless your organ or leslie speaker has an auxillary line into plug into, you will have to plug into an separate amplification system to hear the drum machine."

2150,"I've been noticing reviewers speaking about ""burn in"". What is required with these buds?","I've happily owned a pair of these phones for a while, and use them daily.  I'm aware of burn-in considerations, especially as I used to mess around with high end speakers and drivers years ago.  My experience with these exact phones is that the bass notes did show some increased quickness within a couple of weeks.  It was nothing earth shattering, but I remember noting that the bass response got a little more responsive as the phones broke-in.  I do not believe that the Sennheisers need a formal break in with white noise generators or any such tools.  It's just that you'll notice that you like them even a little more after the initial listening period.  What I've noticed also is that I'm accustomed to the sound of these phones and when I use a different set, I'm not at all happy with the strange phones.

2151,who made: Is from china or japan or usa,"This one is Japanese components and I believe it is assembled in the us i could be wrong about that but definitely Japanese components, I have one and it is an amazing mixing board it even has conpressors"
2152,Does this microphone offer noise cancelling feature?,"On the Noise Cancelling, not that I can see. I will say its very high quality. you will not be disappointed. This is a pro mic."
2153,Is this useful if you use a wireless system to transmit the signal from instrument to pedal board?,This is used as a direct input from your pedals (or instrument) to the sound board or PA system. Allows frequency tailoring via parametric EQ controls as well as signal boost. Can be powered by 9 volt battery or phantom power signal from the sound board.
2154,Does this Fender 007 two button switch work with a Fender Super Champ X2 Head and cabinet?,Yes
2155,Will this fit the Dean Schenker V's with the large style headstock?,I compared the measurements of my dean dave mustaine vmnt to your guitar and it should fit.  The scale of the vmnt is an inch taller and the v base is pointed not round.  My vmnt fits just fine and I believe yours will as well.
2156,Will this case fit this ukulele?http://www.amazon.com/Woods-Guitars-WU902-Soprano-Ukelele/dp/B005FDJDJ6/ref=sr_1_97?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=,I cannot tell because the ukulele ad doesn't tell the length measurement. Mine fits into the case. My uke has a total length of 21 1/4 inches and just fits. I can only guess that it probably would since it looks like a typical soporano uke.
2157,"Can I save a song on the neo, then later, add more to it, and then save the new version as a DIFFERENT TITLE, (as a separate, different song) ?","In my experience, you can add tracks to a song any time and save but you cannot rename.  it will always have the same name.  You can do a master/mix down then save the master to the fat partition, then you can export the song to a pc thru the USB port.  Once the audio file is in your pc you can rename it anything you want.  Also when the neo puts your song in the fat partition it will have a default name like song001 etc.  All songs save in the fat partition have the same time and date extensions regardless of when they were made.   This requires some careful planning when handling multiple recordings.  The audio quality of the neo is so excellent thes problems are tolerable.

2158,Does it fit Rode Videomic Pro?,"I don't think so.  I am pretty sure you will need the ""VMP Deadcat Wind Muff"" which is designed to fit that microphone."
2159,Would you recommend this product for a fitness instructor? Small to medium size classes- outdoors.,"Without question, it should work for that. I used it at an outdoor function for the homeowners association and it was great. It has both a hand held mike and a ear bud type so it should be perfect for your application."
2160,"How would you connect an iPod, to one of these subs and two Eon 515XT's, to get stereo sound from the 515's?","1/8"" to stereo XLR cable goes into the A and B ins (I'm assuming you do A=Left B=R, but it's up to you) on the subwoofer.  Then an XLR cable goes from the A out on the sub to the in on the left Eon, another XLR cable goes from the B out on the sub to the in on the right Eon.  Make sure the switch on the back is set on HPF."
2161,Does this mixer have phantom power?,"Hi Johnny, yes it does have phantom power.  There is switch next to the power switch to turn phantom on."
2162,I understand that ACID PRO is a recording music editor.Can I use this like a music equalizer so I can make adjustments to listen to music perfectly,Acid Pro 7 is a music creation program primarily. Using it as an EQ would be overkill. Youre better off buying a physical EQ console.
2163,Is it with a USB attachement?,"The PROcaster is an XLR microphone geared towards broadcast. There is a different model, the PODcaster, which is geared towards podcasting and using USB."

2165,does it work on a memorex karoke machine,I honestly do not know if it does or not. I bought it as a back up to a wireless mic. So I haven't even used this one.
2166,what kind of reed does it come with,I believe it was a number 2
2167,Is this a suitable case for Jackson RR guitar...thanks,Yes it is. I had a Jackson KV Jenna and it was perfect. I also put in my 1993 Jackson Rhoads in it which is offset V and it was fine. Both 22 and 24 Fret are fine in this case. Its one of the more affordable cases that combine a hard and soft in one. Hope this helps. I have been asked before about 7 String guitars and the headstock is a bit too long and makes the guitar rub inside and cause unessary wear in the case that is not needed.
2168,"Do these eons have a ""speaker out:"", allowing for another speaker to be driven off amlifier?","No.  They do have a signal pass thru that can be routed to another *powered"" speaker."
2169,Is this flute with Gemeinhardt warranty? How many year?,The flute instrument is guaranteed to the original purchaser for three years from the date of purchase.
2170,does it work with the ps3? i have two headsets for my laptop that i could use on my ps3 if i had an adapter!,That was my question too.  I think it does.http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductReview.aspx?Item=N82E16812186035
2171,How short/tall is the included stand? How long is the boom arm?,"3ft to 4ft tall, the boom is about 2-3ft in length"
2172,Does it come with any kind of desktop stand? What are most of you using for that? I don't want a huge retracted floor stand on my desktop.,"It does not come with a desktop stand, I use this ""On Stage DS7100 B Desktop Microphone Stand (Black)"", which is pretty good and it fits perfectly with this mic."
2173,"Would it work for youth guitar, assume it's adjustable?",Yes
2174,"For a 3/4 size laminate guitar with a neutral or even dead sound to it, will 80/20 strings brighten it up?",That is a good question. Any new strings will brighten it up then question is for how long. These will be brighter than the silk and steels which give a warmer sound.
2175,"22 strings, so it has sharping levers for all strings?","yes, it does."
2176,Will this work to play music from my laptop out through my mixer?,I have not tried that but I highly doubt that it will work for computer out to mixing board since it is designed for mixer out to computer. What you need is something like a Peavey USB-P which is usb out of a computer to a box that gives you a left and right transformer isolated xlr out. That is the best way to not only hook up the output of your computer but also to help eliminate any unwanted noise.
2177,What are the dimensions of this case?,It is 25 5/8 inches long inside by 9 1/4 inches wide on the widest part of the base. This case is mildly flexible. So it would hold a uke that was a quarter inch to long easily. Although it would not be as easy to slip my uke in the case. I have another tenor case I have to but the uke in neck first. It's a hard side case. Good luck.
2178,can you hook up an mp3 or ipod ? I can't tell if I can hook up an mp3 or ipod to this ?  Anyone know ?,"On the back it has a ""red,white,yellow"" but they're INPUT only.  There is NO audio input jack (3.5mm or red/white or otherwise) to be able to plug an MP3/iPod into it."
2179,How can you hook up more than one fogger to this remote?  Does this remote only come with one receiver for one fogger or can you get more?,You would need to purchase multiple kits. The controllers from the same model kit are all on the same channel but you can only run one receiver per machine. I bought 3 kits to run 3 fog machines but only use one remote.
2180,what bridge does this come with,"It comes with a basic curved violin bridge, as oppose to a fiddle bridge.  I believe mine also came with an extra bridge.  Some of the reviews suggested that it was not put together and that you would have to take it to a luthier, but mine was ready to play."
2181,This may be a stupid question but I am not a guitarist but am looking for an affordable vocal looper.  Will I be able to plug a mic in and loop?,"Well for some reason DegiTech designed it to where you can't record any instrument whether it be, guitar, keyboard, or a mic while the drum loops are going simultaneously. So yes, you could use a mic to record some kind of background chorus loop with whatever vocal effects, and then you could sing over that for harmony. But you can't have that and the drum loops, both at the same time in the loop (without comp software or a multi-track recorder anyway)."
2182,Would I be a fool to swap out my 2 Mackie SRM450 mains for these smaller sized QSC K8's?,"No. These QSC speakers deliver a much better low end response and the Mackies. I've had some powered Mackie's before, not the ones you are mentioning, but I find the QSC to sound much better. :)"
2183,I wonder now comes with the case?,"yes it comes along with the violin. the case is so nice. but I got another better option to violin also available in amazon,is: full size 4/4 handmade stradivari copy german style violin fiddle case bow set (by generic) this one is much better at lower price highly recommended. good luck"
2184,What size & Synthetic?,20 in. Tall. Wooden. Skin top. Cord tuning.
2185,Helô. This case is for takamine EG523sc-stp? Thanks,Yes I bought that guitar and case off Of amazon and it fits perfectly and has a key to lock it!!!
2186,"does it come with a bench, stand and pedal?","It comes with a Pedal. Doesn't come with a bench or stand. Though, it is a heavier piano, so if you do purchase it, I recommend getting a Z stand and not an X Stand. :) Still, for an electric keyboard, its tone is unmatched for the money in my opinion. Still use it very often."
2187,Does it have 6 steel strings?,Yes.
2188,How long is it (in inches),I am not for sure.  But we got it for our 10 year old grandson who is small and it is perfect for him.
2189,does this drum set come with a drum throne and sticks? Also can I plug in my mp3 player to play along with it?,"It  comes with once set of sticks..roughly 2b...no seat, but does have the mix in to plug in any mp3 through headphone jack"
2190,what's the difference between colors?,None
2191,How is the clean tone?,"Clean is very good, the other settings are very loud - but can be set anyway you wish.  The effects are good, have to watch the echo, if it is not set off when powering up the amp, it makes a loud pop."
2192,why does my px 330 pick up radio signals,"Radio signals are everywhere.  Sometimes our electronics can receive those signals unintentionally.Your keyboard is probably not at fault.  In fact, unless the electronics in your keyboard have been damaged physically, it is extremely unlikely that it could be the cause.Changing the power strip or wall receptacle your keyboard is plugged into may help.You may want to try moving the keyboard. You might be able to clear it up by moving it only a few inches.Sometimes a situation like this may occur temporarily and never reappear again.  You may want to simply give it a little while to see if it goes away by itself.

2193,The version you are selling is the new one with the larger dividers in the main pocket?,"Yes I purchased this also & it is the newer version with the better longer divider pockets, very nice case."
2194,Does it work on a 12-string guitar?,Yes since you set the tuner.
2195,"Description says ""Removable Stroboscope Light (Not included)""; a review mentions strobe ""way off""... does it come with a strobe? If so, a good one?","It does come with a strobe. I keep it adjusted at the upper range of speed, but that was when the line voltage was 106.6.  Line voltage varies tremendously. This is an inexpensive turntable and does NOT have a synchronous ""locked into 60 cycle"" motor. I think it performs well for the money. :)"
2196,What kind of battery does this use? Is it removable? Thank you.,"It uses 2 AA batteries. Yes, they are removable. You can also use rechargeable AA batteries. The M10 has a menu setting so you choose whether you are using regular store bought batteries or the rechargeables. The menu setting determines how the battery charge indicator reports back to you.BTW - battery life is exceptional!The M10 is a favorite choice of many tapers.Check out the website taperssection.com. Do a search for the thread Sony PCM-M10 in the recording gear forum. It's a huge 7 part thread that has great information. You will not go wrong with this unit."
2197,"I know this is saying drum set so that includes the snare, and bass drum as well as the cymbals n foot petal?","Yes, this set comes with everything.  It also has the key in order to adjust the sound, my son loves it, he's had it almost a year and we've had no problems at all."
2198,Does this come with the 4 signal wires and the connector for mounting to tone arm? I could not tell from looking at the picture.,Yes it does! I had to ask the same question when I bought my first headshell. Good Luck!
2199,Is this compatible with FL Studio?,"Yes, it is, from 10.5 and up.  They have templates you start new projects directed towards it. Once you figure out Performance Mode, you can get it working on old projects."
2200,Can it be used with a keyboard / piano?,Experience says these 'cheaper' line pedals don't sound paired with anything other than guitar.Compression can be controlled with MIDI under live situations or added during recording mix.Also you don't have the control with guitar effect pedals as you would with the proper keyboard sustain pedal.Check keyboards that accept sustainer foot pedals; Sweetwater sells the pedals for $15.You can find them cheaper here on Amazon thru M-Audio for around $10.Keep looking and read up on it.
2201,Is this model USA-made?,No England
2202,How old should the kid be?,They suggest ages 3 - 8....thanks!
2203,Is it a dual voltage item for 110V U.S. & 220V Europe?,"No, it is not.  Just 110-120V US."
2204,Could these 3 items be successfully used at meetings for people with very soft voices?,"I think it would be fine.  We have it plugged into a keyboard for the kid and the amplification isn't the greatest but I think it's just because of the speaker it is being projected out of.  If you a better speaker, the mic would be great."
2205,"Will this send the USB as individual channels to the computer, or is it just one ""glob""?",Just one glob!! I would prefer individual channels other than that I love it
2206,Could you hook up a ukulele and a keyboard together through this amp?,not sure abut a ukulele but I do hook a guitar up with it; so probably yes then.
2207,what note is played?,"Hello Wendy. These are handmade pieces and they are all going to have variances in their tonal properties depending on how they were turned, how the metal was cast, how much of each type of metal is in the alloy, etc. I think that is what makes them so unique."
2208,will it fit my epipohne cj 200 ?,I do not know what a CL 200 is but it fits my full size acoustic and it is 45 inches long standard dreadnought shape Hope that helps
2209,"Does the wire have memory, ie, is it hard to straighten?",It is easily straightened by clamping one end in a vise and twisting 3-4 twists per inch with pliers or vise-grips while pulling it straight.
2210,Pandora One streams at 192 kHz. How will this DAC perform with Pandora One?,"The DAC is fine.  What will limit sound quality in this case is not the DAC but rather the upsampling that pandora is guilty of - at least when i sampled music streaming services.  I compared spotify, pandora, and mog, and hands down - Mog was the winner in file quality - dont get bogged down with numbers and listen first.  I cancelled both pandora and spotify immediately."
2211,How to hook speakers up to mixer,XLR (microphone) cords from the back to input on the speakers
2212,"Can you plug this controller into sound module which is plugged into amp and NOT use computer at all? Midi out controller, Midi in sound module.",Yes. There is a single MIDI OUT port on the back. I play mine through a sound module without a computer.
2213,"Just bought an Epiphone Ultra 339... will this fit and if so, what Bigsby Tremolo should I order with it?","The vibramate kits are configured for the corresponding bigbsby.  In other words, the V5 goes with the bigsby B5, and the V7 goes with the B7.   I have 2 les pauls that I have installed both the V5/B5 and the V7/B7 and they both fit.   You will probably want to call the manufacturer to see which(s) fit the Ultra 339."
2214,What could I do indoors with this? How many people? Could I use a mixer to mix a band outside? How far could I go with this?,"I use mine indoors all the time for large parties, karaoke, ipod and for band practice. They sound remarkably good even at lowish volumes, but they are designed for and sound best at moderate to loud volumes due to the size of the woofer. Mine are attached to a passive mixer board, because these have their own built in amps. They can be used outside, if they are kept dry. You could fill a small to moderate sized backyard with the sound these produce before distorting . Mount them on speaker poles if using outside, for better sound projection."
2215,Is there a spot for the cleaning rod?,"There is not specific indented slot for the cleaning rod, but it fits at the back (if laying on side, or the bottom of the case if it is standing up) perfectly. My daughter has hers there and it doesn't roll around or anything."
2216,"Someone told me that this violin does not come with strings when you buy it, is that true?","The violin that we purchased came equipped with strings already installed.  Most of them snapped upon first tuning. We are experience with violins, so this means the strings are of poor quality.  Do your self a favor and order a set of better quality strings in addition to the violin.  Would suggest Daddario prelude steel strings ($15?). They are USA made, and will work well on an electric violin.All the best!"
2217,How do you add external speakers? I haven't found any pic of the back side of keyboard. I'm not buying until I know...,"It's easy.  On the back there is a 1/4"" jack for outside audio.  You can plug in earphones or send the signal to an external audio amp.  I totally love my YPG-235.  I am handicapped by stroke -- my left side is non-functioning, so I play the left hand chords with my right hand and save that in the memory.  I playback the memory and add the right hand to it -- works great.  It's a marvelous piece of good engineering.Dave George"
2218,"Can you fit a mouse on it with a 17"" laptop?",No
2219,With what fretboard radius is this nut slotted?,"Both of my LPs are 12"" radius, and it fits fine."
2220,"I have a Casio key board when you touch the keys they make a louder sound (like a tack, tack) is the Yamaha brand do the same?","No It doesn't.Actually I was going to buy a Casio on the internet. And I was looking through reviews and changed my mind because one of them complained of that noise and suggested that the Yamaha was better.So I went to Yamaha that was going cost only 500$ I can't remember which and it had some sort of problem maybe the same as this one.But the reviewer who claimed to be a professional player suggested that it would have been much better to pay a couple of more hundred dollars and get the Yamaha 640 which is the best in the price range and closest feel to the real thing.And after having it for two months now, I agree.My family absolutely love it. We are very happy with our choice. and no ticking sound at all.

2221,"I need to buy it with a hard case, do you recommend one en amazon?","I know this cost about what the instrument costs, but it has held up nicely and is a hard shell.  Musician's Gear Hardshell A-Style Mandolin Case"
2222,"the keyboard comes with its box? I'm interested , but I have a number of questions.",Yes it comes with a box.
2223,Is the power supply cord included?,Yes it is
2224,Just got it and it doesn't work with my guitar. It does play music though the head phones. Any thoughts?,What app for are you using and what os will not work without a compatible app like andrig for android or irig for Apple iPhone etcetera

2232,i don't have a computer.Can I play it on my DVD player that is hooked to my TV,No.  The disc format is strictly for computer.
2233,"Hi,does it work for a bass guitar??","While it does work for bass, prolonged bass use will presumably shorten its life (as is the case with most amps) due to the lower frequencies involved. Best to go with a dedicated bass amp."
2234,Does the Sonar software come with the purchase?,"Yes, yes it does.  But only works with Windows.  You can work with any software, Mac or Windows based, but Sonar is only for Windows."
2235,Is arm automatic or automatic return?,First of all yes there is a lifting and lowering arm for placing the needle on the album and it auto returns when done . Also there is a locking clip that secures the arm in place when not in use ! It needs to be slid over to the right to un secure the arm before play . I hope this helps please let me know if you need more help or have any more questions . :)
2236,Does this unit have the same pattern which repeats or are there multiple pattern choices?,"Im not completely sure. But my understanding is it has a two patterns the repeat over and over with the push of a button. One of them is sound sensitive I believe, because when room went completely quiet the lights will turn off. But once you clap they turn back on and every clap they change colors. I hope that helps!"
2237,Is this the right size for an 8yr old just learning to play?,I highly suggest it! But a little downside is it might be a little to heavy for him/her.

2242,Does this come with a 12v plug? Not a power supply but just an open-ended cable to plug in?,"No, you have to buy one. Universal 12v works tho."
2243,is the neck slim enough for shorter fingers?,"In my opinion, yes it is.  I happen to have been born with my mom's hands (rather small for the average man), yet I've always been attracted to the Bass guitar & Hand Drums (Congas, etc.).  Yet I've noticed that most of the best bassists (Stanley Clarke, Jaco, Bootsy Collins) tend to have large hands, which makes it easier to manipulate the strings.  Not deterred, I have been practicing for some time with the standard Bass (Fender P-bass) and others.  When I saw this particular bass, I was immediately drawn to it.  It's a beautiful instrument, and much less expensive than whats known as the ""Beatle Bass"" that Sir Paul has played for years.  Rogue has made a fine product here, affordable to those of us who don't play for a living, yet desire a great quality instrument that's beautiful and professional sounding(in the proper HANDS)!  I highly recommend this instrument.  Hope this helps!

2246,"is the neck as wide as a martin, like a D-28 or fender strat or mostly for kids?","It's quite wide, but the downside is the fact that it's very fat and hard to fit my hand around. It's larger than my taylor acoustic and I can't figure out the reason why."

2250,Does this product actually come with the limited edition virtual dj software?,Yes it does!
2251,"What size is the drum pad?  The band director has requested a 10"" or larger practice pad","It is 8"". As a percussion teacher with music ed background, I wonder why the band director has requested 10"" or larger. 8"" is standard and in my opinion preferable to a larger pad for a beginner because the smaller pad keeps students focused on staying in the center. A larger pad tends to promote sloppiness and ""flailing"" for beginners. Hope this isn't too late."
2252,How good is the tremolo?,I bought this for my ten year old grandson for Christmas.  Then I turned around and bought one for my 17 year old grand son.  They love them and use them.  A very good instrument that will stay with them.
2253,One reviewer claim a noticeable hum when capturing to software in the PC.  Anyone else notice the hum ?  Need mixer for vocal in narrations. No hum's,"I experienced no noise,I would say the reviewer was getting noise from a bad cable or the ground loop on his PC."

2255,What is the difference between this metal volume box amp attenuartor and the 8 ohm 50 watt speaker soak?,"After using more than 2 years, I can say:First, the connection, volume box connect in the loop effects, if you use effect pedals in loop effects, put in the last position. The speaker soak from the output of the amp to cabinet. Second, the sound, I use to play with my amphead Blackstar HT 100watts, well it works well, but the tone changes a little, so for practice is ok in my opinion, but if you use with combo amp, 40 or 50 watts, you need to increase the level of volume box and the tone will change but not too much, so in amp combo 50 or under, I prefer to not use volume box. The Speaker soak is better, it is like true by pass, not change the tone, but it is very very expensive.I hope to have responsed you.

2259,whats the difference of 4 ohms and 8 ohms? Im getting a hartke ha2500 and am looking for a good 2x10 cabinet that has a good low end sound and punch,"Hi Robert,Without getting too technical, the impedance is a measure of how electricity behaves (or is restricted/resisted in a signal path) with regards to speakers and amps. In this SA-210 @ 4Ω, we have two 8Ω speakers wired together in parallel, creating the overall 4Ω load for the cabinet or enclosure. I have taken a look at the Hartke HA2500 and based on their specifications I can only assume that the 250W @ 4Ω they have listed is a Peak measurement. This would put the Hartke Model 2500 at about 125W RMS @ 4Ω (I am speculating here since this measurement is not listed). Being that the SA-210 is rated at 400W RMS @ 4Ω, you will be underpowering this cabinet. The tendency when underpowering is to boost the signal, which in turn could cause you to clip, and eventually ""blow"" the speakers. The ideal rating for the amp to push the SA-210 would be 600W RMS @ 4Ω, or 1.5 times the RMS value of the speaker. Having said all that, you can use the Hartke to power the SA-210, but you must be careful not to clip your signal. Let us know if you have any questions.Thanks,Rusty

Show Less","Probably not. The curved ""hooks"" would barely grasp the front edge of the guitar body and the highest vertical part is only 6"" up - not very secure for a 36"" length guitar."
2269,Does this guitar accommodate a strap?,There is a button for a strap on the bottom of the body. Then you use a piece of string or something to tie above the nut on the neck (under the strings) to the other end of the strap.
2270,I am buying this to use with Rocksmith on Ps3 - can I get the game without the cable or do I have to buy the game with the cable,You will need to buy the cable.
2271,its made in?,China
2272,"are the cabinets ""closed back"" style?",Closed and if you want to change that you're better off just buying open back cab.the speaker jack is attached to the wood backing itself
2273,Any soft case that can go with this?,Yeup universal case
2274,How many lumens??? Neither this one nor the less bright hitlights pages mention how many lumens their strips are. How can I compare? I'm looking for 1500 lumens total...,These lights offer 220 lumens per foot.
2275,"Do it have a jack to hook up headphones, so we don't hear it in the house when he plays?",Yes.
2276,this comes with a pop filter correct? it says it in the title but it does not say it is included in the details?,"Yes, it ""comes with a pop filter"" although it is just another seperately packaged item that shows up in the box with it. But for the price (I beleve $70) you DO get a pop filter. It is fairly large and a sturdy construction. And the mic itself it very nice. I would absolutly recomend to anybody."
2277,Can an audio track be split or shortened?,Yes it can be split and shortend by using wave pad sound editor its very easy.
2278,The one picture shows this holding plastic game guitars. Can this hold reg guitar? Would a metal hanger be better?,"Of the few guitar hangers I tried, none accommodated all of the different kinds of guitars that I own, and cost upward of $40. I purchased one of these for 1/10th of that price. It was easier to install, and even though it seems a bit small at first, it is made of aluminum, nicely padded, plenty strong, and effortlessly adjustable to any size or shape of stringed instrument. Out of the 8 bass and various other types of guitars I own, 5 of them are hanging on the walls of my home from these very hangers. Don't waste your money buying a more expensive one. Buy more guitars instead, and hang them from these holders!

2283,"what are the actual dimensions, ie: length, hole size and diameter?","The windscreens are approximately 1 inch long, with a 3/8 inch hole that will stretch somewhat.  The order that I worked with included five of the devices and I was able to stretch the first windscreen to fit the longnecked mini microphone that we use on the pulpit at our church."
2284,do these lights have two positive and negative ends,No.  One positive lead and one negative.  With a soldering iron though you could easily put however many leads on there that you want.
2285,"Does everything use the same wifi frequencies because they're ""unlicensed"" ?","Does not operate on wifi. It operates on a less used and wide frequency that wireless phones use. It has a couple of different channels to select from to avoid interference. I have 3 in different locations around the house and workshop and no problems other trying to use one at extreme distances then, like a wireless phone, static ensues."
2286,is it easy to learn how to use this machine since i am going to start making beats for the first time,It's not difficult but it's also not a piece of cake. Expect 4 to 6 moths before you can start making good beats.
2287,How much does it weigh?,"33 pounds, is on the specifications. Regards"
2288,Will it work with first generation iPod?,Nope. Not at all. Only iphone and ipod 4th
2289,will this work to replace my discontinued adaptor model PA-6?,Seems like there was a list of adapters that this would work for in the description.  ?   I recall finding the one I needed on the list and it was a better price through Amazon than the one offered from music dealer.
2290,I sing using background music.  Can I use my iPhone and plug in a mic for use at the same time?,Yes! U can pit the music using bluetooth a 2 mics at same time
2291,is this 240V ?,"Dear Chaminda, it's both voltage. Work in 110v and 220v. Here in Brazil we have both systems and works perfectly. BTW, this mixer is amazing!!!!"
2292,will a 4500 watt amp work these speakers,I have a 3000 watt amp and it's too much for them.
2293,"Q: The expanded view photos shows what appears to be a fiberboard case, but in description it only mentions a padded gig bag.","Hi, at least in my case the sitar came with a gig bag and with a sort of hard paperboard case (not fiberboard), probably only for protecting the instrument during shipping (not very good quality), but anyway it can be useful if you don't have a better one. I hope it helps. Cheers! Good instrument!!"
2294,Can I keep my ipad charging at the same time?  I need to broadcast a ceremony (1-2 hours long...)  and worry about the battery life.,"Mikey connects to the iPad via the same port as the battery charger.   However, Mikey has a mini USB port on the side which, with the proper cable, you will be able to charge the iPad while recording with Mikey.  However, if you have your iPad full charged before you begin recording, I think you should have no trouble in recording two hours without charging."
2295,I am interested purchasing this for my 13 year old nephew.  Would you recommend this for 13 year old?,My Husband and I purchased it for our 9 year old daughter and she loves it. So yes I believe that your nephew will love it!

2300,Does this case fit an Epiphone ES-339 Pro?,My es 339 p90 pro fits great.
2301,"Would you please tell me, what difference between: GTD Audio G-733H and GTD Audio G-788H",I have owned the G-788H for a year now as a DJ and it is diffrent from the G-733H in that the G-788H uses 4 antennas (two for each channel) one to send amd one for return. This reduces noise and is more reliable and it works great.  Also the G-788H has the anntenas mount on the back side of the unit so if you rack mount you will have to take that into consideration.  I think for the money these mic systems are fantastic and the vocal range and  clearity have been superb.
2302,Are they adjustable so that we can move the mic back and forth in relation to the ear hooks.,"Yes, this headset is adjustable that way.  The entire length of the flexible boom slides through the clips that hold it on either side of the headset.."
2303,Do you have to use a screwdriver to replace the battery?,"No, its a clip-on battery cover.. Doesnt hold on very well. I have it on a velcro pedal board with a power supply but the bit of velcro i put on the battery cover will stay on my board with the cover when i move my the joyos around."
2304,How tall are the legs?,"36"""
2305,I have a Rode ntg3 with the shock mount. Can I use this boom pole? Or do I have to get the Rode boom pole.,"Hi! Thank you for your interest in our products.

This boom pole has a standard 5/8""-27 threads with solid brass male end and your Rode came with Auray a DUSM-1 Universal Shock mount which has a 3/8""-16 Thread Base. Sorry."
2306,does it come with the screws,Yes it does
2307,what are the clear width x depth x ht. dimensions that a laptop will fit inside the formed top tray as shown in the picture.,width is 12 inches and depth is 1/4 inch. length 15 inches. The height on the pedestal is adjustable. My laptop is larger but I have it on top and I can work very easily and it is secure enough.
2308,I am confused by the dimensions.  Reads 9.7 x 8.6 x 0.4 inches.  How tall is the strip and how thick?,"The cross section of the 16 ft strip is about 1/2"" by 3/16"". See my comment to my post. Two of the 3 LED segments have stopped working after one year being exposed to the elements."
2309,Has anyone played any slide and/or old Blues on this guitar?  I'm learning and I'm looking for an affordable guitar with good sound.,"I've tried standard, open D & G tunings with slide technique on the Honey Dipper.  You should be very pleased with the guitar.  As others have commented it is a heavy metal object, but that's where the sound you're looking for originates.  Go for it."
2310,Can this be used as a wireless device?,No its wired if you read the description. There is wireless versions as well.
2311,"Does the guitar need assembly on purchase ? I hope it can be played out of the box. Tuning I can manage, but not assembly.",No assembly required.
2312,Can I use a regular microphone stand or do I need to purchase a stand specifically made for a theramin?,"A regular mic stand is exactly what you would need if you wish to mount the theremin on a stand.  If the stand has a retaining nut, please remove the nut before mounting the theremin.  It will slip over the threads and sit snugly on the stand.  Please be aware that a stand is not required, although it can be a welcome addition.  You can play this instrument as a tabletop model.  Thanks!"
2313,can two ev. elx115p be enough for a 3000sf as a church,"hello, yes, these speakers are very powerful, the downside is that they bring much static noise, so you must make a good EQ and use a maximaizer, that's my recommendation, I have one of these speakers to sell, what I used twice, if you're interested. I hope my answer will help."
2314,are these piano sized keys?,"Although I no longer own it, since I upgraded to a Kawai, I do believe they have the same sized keys.  Just less of them.  Also be aware these keys are not touch sensitive nor are they weighted."
2315,What height is the stand when open (to hold the keyboard)?,It's adjustable to seated or standing height.
2316,Does the XDJ-Aero require a wi-fi connection to home wi-fi to wirelessly connect to devices? Or does the XDJ-Aero use it's own wi-fi address?,uses its own address wi-fi
2317,"does the px350 have an aux line out like the yamaha p105 that is ""true line-output, the built-in speakers remain on for monitoring""?","It has two 1/4"" headphone out jacks that disable the built in speakers, and two 1/4"" line out jacks that do not."
2318,"I am looking for a system that I can use to sing using recorded music (CD, MP3) Are their inputs for that? I can't seem to zoom in enough to tell..","there are four av jacks on the front and a main one on the back we use ours for kareeokee its pluged into the front av jack which sounds great,we also use a small tv for a bigger monitor overall our own private system,just as good as any in a bar,hope this helps."
2319,can you use an ipod classic with this?,Yes. It uses the aux cable to connect iPad to karaoke player. Any device with a headphone jack will work
2320,Will this nut fit a Squier Affinity Strat? I realize some minor filing may be necessary.....just want to be sure it's not too narrow for the slot.,"It should, that's what I used mine on."
2321,Is this for Brass Instruments?,"Yes it should work well with virtually any instrument, I've used it on Sax many times."
2322,Do you have to use music in order for it to work or can you just use it as a regular microphone?,"You can use it without the cd's.  My 3 year old Granddaughter sings happy birthday and twinkle twinkle little star all the time, and my 1 year old Grandson loves to just make noises and hear his own voice."
2323,is it a real guitar or is it a picture of it,It's real
2324,Can it play just a drum rythym loop? Basically like a drum machine?,It can. And very realistically! It's got quite a few rhythm patterns of various genres. Really handy when you're trying to record a backing track.
2325,"Would the case fit an Ibanez aw 250 dreadnaught guitar? 41"" long; 16"" wide and 5' deep roughly?","it's 45 x 17 inside, it's heavy, massive, well made- fits probably any normal guitar! my classic has room to spare- almost to big!"
2326,what are the dimensions of this item?,"The wood block is chamfered and has a 1 3/4"" by 4"" base (part that touches the wall) tapered to a 1 1/4"" by 3 1/2"" top where hook is screwed in.  The entire unit sticks out 5 5/8"" from the wall.  The distance between to two prongs (hook) is 2""."
2327,How long is the cord from the headset to the transmitter plug?,1.2m (about 48-inches).  A comfortable length to go from earset to waist transmitter even on very tall individuals.
2328,"Is the 12"" height inclusive of the small 'legs' - and are the 'legs' adjustable for desk usage?  If so, how much height do they add?","The 12"" height does not include the legs. About 15"" total with legs and taking into consideration the knobs that tighten sides into place at the top. Legs are a single height, not adjustable."
2329,"it""s good guitar?","It's a good guitar (for the price) if it is set up correctly. Since everything is raw wood, finishing could be a challenge if you do it yourself. The hardware is bottom of the line but functional. The holes are not pre drilled for the neck and it's very important that they be drilled correctly. Depending on what model you get, the headstock is not pre formed...it's basically a block of wood with holes pre drilled for the tuning pegs. You'll have to use a lathe or router to form it or take it to a wood worker. The upside to that is you can personalize it any way you want. For the money it's a functioning guitar that is fun to build and plays well if it's set up properly.

2330,Does this case fit the new model Soundlink 3?,It fits the device itself perfectly. You will still need another bag for the A/C power chord and the lighter device.
2331,does a coronado or a starcaster fits in here?,"If it's the hollow bodied guitar probably not.  Newer lower end starcasters that are basically shaped like a stratocaster should.  Older Starcasters were hollow bodied guitars, they recently reissued versions of the older hollow body models.  I doubt that guitar will fit this case."
2332,Does this case have a sliding laptop stand or not. The reviews say it does but the picture doesn't show a sliding stand. I don't want the slidingstand,"Hi,the FZPIDDJSX does not have the glide style lap top stand.  If you are looking for the Glide style, you should look into FZGSPIDDJSX.Hope that answered your question.If you have any other questions or want to purchase this product, please give us a call at 323-730-5050 @ AVLGEAR.Thank you!"
2333,Does your full sized violin fit well into the case and does it come with shoulder straps?,"Yes, it does come with shoulder straps.  My daughter's 4/4 violin fits in very snug, not too tight and not too much room to slip around."
2334,Does this work for non-yamaha receivers? I have a Harman Kardon AVR-500,"Yes. It will work with any brand as long as the receiver has a digital coax input. The only other issue is power. If the receiver does not have a built in usb port to power the YBA-11, then you will have to buy a usb power adapter to plug in to the wall."
2335,Dose it serve the purpose ?,"Yes, it does... I actually bought this for my musically talented girlfriend... She uses it and makes tracks with ease... I will say though, it's way over my head and I have no idea how to work that thing..."
2336,"Is this a good piano keyboard to learn while traveling?  I travel a lot for work, but am never around my piano at home to learn.  It would be great if",it great midi keyboard! as long as you have a mac computer. (i haven't tried it with a pc) easy to use and great for traveling!

2338,Would a banjo work well with this stand?,Yes
2339,Is this Amp V.2? I saw it said it was in a picture showing the back of the amp but I'd like to know if it is from someone thats bought it.,"Yes.  There are two ways to distinguish between the version 1 and version 2 Mustang.  The first, and most easily observed, is that the name is behind the control knobs, and is italicized; the second is that the covering on the version 1 has a carbon-fibre look, as opposed to the traditional tolex of the version 2."

2341,Can you use batteries?,No it's ac only  no off switch
2342,Does it need adaptor to use it with new or old ios conections?,It needs an adaptor to use with the lightning connection - 4th gen iPad and iPhone 5..
2343,Does the rotary gain control go to 11?,It does not.
2344,Can I take song out from this cubase for infinitive times as MP3 ???? or is it limited??,I can export it with good quality but it is not mp3 it's wav 64 or some more options not mp3
2345,Can I connect an overdrive pedal to this? Will the overdrive pedal sound the same if it weren't connected to the POD?,"You can connect extra pedals to the Pod HD 500X. There are two 1/4"" ports that you can plug any number of chained pedals into and you then just add an ""FX"" box into the string of effects on the screen. You can then turn these pedals on and off using the POD's effect switch buttons, if you assign the FX box to it. As to how it sounds, that would depend on which place in your effect line up that you put the FX box, but if you are running an unaltered sound through the POD, it should not affect the signal at all, and should sound as if it is just running through your external effect pedal.Alternatively, you can run the audio out, either from the Phones port or the L or R out ports into your effect box, and just have the pod be just another string in your effects. Or you could plug your guitar into the effect box and run that into the ""Guitar in"" port on the pedal.

2349,hi! could anybody explain me the difference between the DGX 650 and DGX 640?,"There are 4 main New Features for the DGX 650 over the DGX 640. These include the STYLE RECOMMENDER (helps you find appropriate backing track (drums etc.) based on the rhythm of a song you are playing), AUDIO RECORDING - the ability to record audio in WAV format (not just MIDI anymore!), SPEAKER OVERRIDE (can route keyboard through sound system and keep the sound coming out of the keyboard speakers also so you can use the keyboard speakers as your monitor).  This is very important to me, and AUX INPUT (play along with an  MP3 player).  --BB"

2355,does it have a midi imput,No. It only has jacks for power and headphones.
2356,Do you get good rebound or do you have to make the rebound happen yourself.,"Dear Ivan, in air-drumming, you can get rebound off the palm of your hand by using a relaxed German grip (palms facing somewhat down). The rebound happens because the butt of the drumstick bounces on the fleshy part of your palm. This enables you to drum as fast as on a real drum. We explain this in a video we made about rebound. Unfortunately, it is not possible for me to place an internet link here. I encourage you to search youtube for ""Aerodrums"" and ""rebound""."

It fits all standard tonearm headshells, including the Dual (German-made) plug-in design.  This cartirdge, however will not work with the P type headshell mount (Ortofon).  The Gimbal bearing on your Technics is high enough in the back to present a decent clearance for slightly warped records when played by the M44, as well as a decent palying angle for the stylus in the groove.  The Pioneer PL-518 Gimble bearing has a flatter playing angle, which is perfectly safe on the records, but the warpage clearance is poor.  This will be an excellent fit for the Technics SL-23.  You will need the longer mounting screws for the M44.  I believe they come with the cartridge.  I didn't have to worry about the screws since I had quite an arsenal of hardware to mount mine.  But, I do believe the classic, longer M44 mounting screws are in the cartridge packaging.

2365,What are the outputs? RCA? uSB? Is there a pre-amp?,"Output is RCA with a ground. There is no USB. There is also no built-in pre-amp. I purchased one also made by Pyle and it works great. Only negative to this player I've found is that it does not have an auto-return for the arm when the record is done playing. Had I known this, I probably would have shelled out a bit more for one that does, as the previous players I've used have had this feature... perhaps it's not common in ""professional"" players?"
2366,does this microphone have to be plugged into anything? NADY SP-4C Dynamic Microphone,"All microphones, except those at the end of a megaphone or bullhorn, need to be plugged into an amplifier (or preamp which is plugged into an amplifier) to which speakers are connected.  The connection from the microphone to the amplifier may be by wire, or by wireless transmitter.  For this particular microphone, the Nady SP-4C, the connection is by the included microphone cable."
2367,how much candlepower does it have??,I am unsure of that.  My husband used it to DJ a party in a banquet hall that held over 100 people.  It did well but it was mainly for the dance floor area.  Hope that helps.
2368,"Anyone ever use one of these as a bass guitar cab? I'm thinking of using one in conjunction with a GK 210 (2 ten inch speaker) cab, also 8 0hm..","Yeah, Don't."
2369,anyone used this on spark plug leads to clean and improve contact between spark plug and the lead?,"I have not used it for that application, buy I would think that it would work well at removing any corrosion if it exists.  It can't hurt in any case.  I've been using DeOxit for many tears and have found that it works wonders on any and all electrical contacts.  One area that people forget are the various ground straps or cables they have in the engine compartment.  Disconnect them and clean well with De-Oxit and replace tightly.  I've seen cleaning the grounds fix some strange electrical problems."
2370,how to connect this to my interface?,We used it for a live setup. This go a the end of the preamp chain. This way we process the final mix of the instruments. There are people who use it only for bass instruments as an instrument effect with good results.
2371,"If I buy this, would I have to buy anything else for it to function?","Yes, you need to purchase the adapter or a 9 volt battery. I recommend the adapter."
2372,what type of case could i buy for this guitar,"I purchased ""Musicians Gear Deluxe SGS Solid Guitar Style Hardshell Case"" Sold by Music123 Paid $59.99 at the time. Well worth the price. Guitar fits good, inside is plush and is well built. Not sure how it would handle if your on the road, but for home & short trips it suits my needs perfectly."
2373,Will a seagull s12 fit?,I'm not sure it's not my add. I do own a skb 18 case and my acoustic fits it. Just measure your guitar against the guitar case inside measurements ask skb. My guitar fits easy I even put towels or shirts in it as packing for plane flights below. It handled 4 plane flights so far and guitar is ok. Hope this helps.
2374,What is the thickness of these picks?,according to jim dunlop website...it 1.38 mm
2375,Can it handle deep bass tones or is the hog 30 better for that range?,"Others have spoken as owners of the Hog 20. I have a Hog 30 I've used for busking in Farmer's markets on bass. It held up just fine in that context, so I think for keyboards or bass if you want a battery operated amp, the Hog 30 is a great option."
2376,"Is the top tube one solid tube through the center, or two short tubes connecting in the middle with support struts connecting below?","It's a solid tube, approximately 3ft. in length."
2377,I can use this on electric bass?,"Absolutely! I love this stuff so much I just sent it to my daughter today--don't tell her, it's a surprise! But seriously, I use it on all my instruments, acoustic and electric and there is something in there for everything. All the best, George"
2378,"Whats the difference between the Shubbs S1 and the Deluxe S1 capo ? Thanks, Mick","I think the product is the same, but the listings with different names are different sellers. They just used different words for the same product.  ???"
2379,"The description says it fits standard 1-inch tubing. Is this the inner diameter of the tubing, or the outer diameter?",It seems to refer to outer diameter per my measurement
2380,How does it compare to a Martin 12-string Acoustic Electric (Dreadnaught) guitar?,"The only Martin 12 I owned was boomy and dull and disappointing. I traded it in on a Taylor spruce/mahogany auditorium guitar which is a delight but which lacks the clangy jangly tones of the Tak. Between the two, I should cover my Appolonian and Dyonisian selves. I've never even played a Martin 12 since, and haven't missed it. Also, the Tak is considerably cheaper, given the electrics etc. Hope this helps."
2381,how much this head shell weigh in grams?,"It's a knockioff of the Technics Headshell, which is 7.3 grams.  Amazon should update the stats, as they ARE confusing......"
2382,does this foot switch work with any yamaha keyboards,"I have the YPG-235 and it works fine.  The sustain does not have the fade out one is used to on an acoustic, but I have been  very happy with this add on purchase for my Yamaha keyboard."
2383,Does this Harmonica come with a case? I don't see anything on this site that suggest that it comes with it.,"The Lee Oskar harmonicas come in interlocking cases. When you have several of them, as I do, they become a sort of box with several small lids. Definitely the best case design in the harmonica world."
2384,Will this case fit the Yamaha DGX-230?,I used it with the Yamaha YPG-235 and it worked great.
2385,Will a Washburn B-16 banjo fit in the TKL 7840 case?,Yes it will.
2386,Will the electric EJ200 fit with the knobes on the upper shouldermaking it a half inch wider?,My guitar is a ej 200 ce  with the control and tuner on top this case  works great I love it hope this helps ray
2387,MXL 990 Condenser Microphone to USB I was hoping to connect this mic to my computer via USB for podcast recording.  Would I be able to connect it directly or would I need additional equipment?,"""Would I be able to connect it directly or would I need additional equipment?""You may not want a mixer, it depends on what you own already. Basically to connect a condenser mic like this to your PC via USB (and you probably do not want to use direct sound from typical audio in on PCs or Macs) is an audio interface, and for microphones you want it compatible with the powered Low-Z, which can be done combined or separate.If you went completely modular, you could buy the mic (I assume you mean this): MXL 990 Condenser Microphone with ShockmountThen for its phantom power: Nady SMPS-1X 1-Channel 48V Phantom Power Supply for Condenser MicrophonesAnd then an audio interface ranging from this very nice option: Lexicon Alpha 2-Channel Desktop Recording StudioOr this: M-Audio Fast Track USB 2 Computer Audio Interface and at about that price you might be able to find one that eliminates the need for the separate ""phantom"" power.All tolled, I think having the Nady power supply is a great idea, because many audio interfaces that have phantom power can only drive one mic. I think given the limits of USB, I understand why it might not be a great idea to drive more than one mic that way. I am thinking about buying one for myself as insurance, because I have a lot of audio interfaces that have the correct XLR, but power for only one, or no phantom power. I also get nervous from having so many USB devices in the first place, and I buy powered hubs to make sure I don't overly tax my PC power supply, since I have 2 video cards and a 6-core CPU. All this stuff adds up. The final option is starting from about $60 you can get a USB condenser, and then I remembered this for under $50: BEHRINGER C-1UThe downside of buying the all in one is that you can't use the USB mic in a mixer for example. For many people though, it makes a lot of sense.  There is also another option for almost the same price: CAD U37 USB Studio Condenser Recording MicrophoneBut don't let the confusion intimidate you in to gambling before you know what you really need. The more info you share about your system (your PC and gear) and any other likely uses, the better advice people can offer you. Don't be afraid to share your requirements.

2388,what is the best starter ukele,"Tuning is great and good  finishing,  taking into consideration the fact that the Oscar Schmidt OU2 Concert Ukulele is not a an expensive model. However you have to remember that the concert uke is an  intermediate size between the tenor (bigger) and soprano (smallest). So, for begginers it is a good choice."
2389,"my plug is the opposite of everything I found if the ground is North, the T is on the West and the vertical is East is this something different?",What you have there is a Nema 6-20P 240V appliance. Leg1+Leg2+Ground instead of Leg1+Neutral+Ground. You can't run such an appliance off 120V (unless you use a step-up transformer). The easiest and least expensive solution is probably to install a 240V circuit.
2390,This is a 4ohm or 8ohm head?,"Jonathan, here is some information that might help320W @ 8 Ohms480W @ 4 Ohms700W or 480W Amp Only:¼"" speaker outputjacks. Impedances Lower than 4 Ohms should not beused. Higher impedances such as 8 Ohms, 16 Ohms,or No Load are acceptable. One 4 Ohm, one 8 Ohm,or two 8 Ohm cabinets are okay. One 4 Ohm and one8 Ohm together is not recommended. The internalspeakers equal an 8 Ohm load. No damage willresult from operating the amplifier with the speakersdisconnected."
2391,Does this fit the Thunderbird Pro 5? That's the 5-string model with the through body neck. Some say it's slightly longer than the IV.,"My thunderbird fits pretty well in here but it still has room for a bit more length. The 5 string should not be that much longer but if it is, it still has room for it. Also the space for the headstock is open enough to fit the extra tuning peg. I would say get this case if you're looking to fit your bass"
2392,what gauge are they? string sizes,"I wouldn't know myself, but on the listing it says this:Gauges : 12-16-25-32-42-54"
2393,I'm an adult but have very small hands. Years ago I played the clarinet with no difficulties and was wondering about spacing and reach on this?,"Not knowing how small your hands are, it's hard to say whether or not you could manage the reach on a standard tenor.  My wife cannot, so we got a bent (knick) tenor with two more keys than the double key for C and C# for her.  She has no trouble with this, but likes to use it with a neck strap.  The  instrument is a YRT-304B modified by Lazar Early Music.  The neck strap arrangement is a jury-rig involving the use of a stout rubber band and a bass recorder strap.  Hope this helps."
2394,"I need to know if the foot switch comes with the locking cable. If not, where can I find one?",It comes with a standard ethernet cable...which snaps in at both ends.  It would be great if it were more flexible.
2395,What's the finish on the stand? Is it black or chrome? Thanks,Black
2396,how much does the guitar weigh?,"I measured it on a kitchen scale (could balance the entire unit on it surprisingly well) with my light weight Ernie Ball strap attached, and it weighed in at 2 lbs. 4.8 oz. For comparison, the Washburn strap that it came with weighs in on its own at 2.4 oz. Why the Ernie Ball strap? The Washburn strap is fine, unless yours smells like a an off-gassing rave at the chemical plant."
2397,Does this keyboard have speakers or do you need to purchase separate speakers?,"It's not a keyboard, it's a midi controller. You need a PC/Mac with speakers + software to use this."
2398,The description says these are nylon strings.  They aren't are they?,"The wound strings hae a nylon core. So, yes and no. The E string is still steel, but the others are nylon with a winding(I can't recall the medal they are wound with). If you're thinking of nylon guitar strings, no they don't resemble those because of the winding."

2400,"Hi, my husband has a Gibson L7 Archtop acoustic guitar (1937)  that I would like to purchase a pickup for. Is this suitable or ideal. He's tried a few","Wow. That's a pretty vintage guitar and very special. It has a completely different style of pickup. I would try to restore the guitar very close to its original state. I would try to buy an original Gibson pickup that's designed for that type of guitar or even a boutique pickup, if that's the case."
2401,"Hello, I am deciding between this auto harp and the OS150FCE Acoustic Electric Auto Harp. Does this one have the FT600 Fine Tuning?","I really like this auto harp, but it does NOT have fine tuning. I haven't had any problems fine tuning it myself though - just a laborious process and needs to be done frequently in the first few months."
2402,are these a pair,"yes, my package had two."
2403,"I'm seeing that some have said it DOESN""T come with screws but it says that it DOES in the description. I want to rack 3 routers/3 switches.","It comes with screws, about 50 of them."
2404,is this mic good for overlaying harmonies and piano???,"This Nady (SP-1) is a pretty decent mic. For the price, its hard to beat. Keep in mind, this is not going to perform like a Shure SM-58. It is, however, a good solid mic that will give you a clean sound with nice highs and a surprisingly good midrange. You should have no problem with harmonies because it does have a pretty nice range and the vocal quality is there. I also think this would work well with a piano, for the same reasons."
2405,Can you recommend an extension pole so that I can increase the total height?,"I'm not aware of any.  I'm sure one could be fashioned to use, but you run the risk of the unit becoming unstable and damage to your other equipment should your modification fail."
2406,Should I buy the junior strap for a 5th grader or can the regular strap be adjusted to fit my 5th grader? He is an average kid in height.,This is the strap we bought for our 5th grader and it was fine. Perfect even.
2407,Does it work on other brands?,I've used it with several makes and models. Works just fine
2408,"I need of it for Fender Stratocaster, what you adivse me to use for volume and 2 tones? My guitar have 3 pickups 1 humbucker and 2 singles.","Hi,A 500 K pot will generally yield a brighter tone, and are normally used with Humbucker pickups, a 250 K pot is the standard with single coil pickups,  a nice medium with HSS guitars is a 250K volume pot with 1Meg Tone controls, this keeps the singles from being too bright or harsh, and helps keep the humbucker from being too muddy,  another option is to wire separate volume controls, 500K for the humbucker, and 250 K for the singles and a master tone controlHope this helpsBrandon"
2409,"How is this unit powered?  Is it battery, a/c or D/C?",120V a/c
2410,Is this guitar worth using for a black metal/sludge/noise project?,"Purely on its own, without inflection from any processing FX? Probably not. But no guitar is, really - is it? This guitar can handle being heavily processed though, so if you have outboard FX, or FX running on a computer, this guitar will give you the s/n ratio you need. I've used this through an old Roland GP8 multiFX processor, a Floor Pod and Native Instruments Guitar Rig and it holds up pretty well. If you're after speed picking, I'd say go with something more refined - this guitar is a great workhorse, but it is crudely constructed. I lucked out with the one I bought, but I've talked to people who've ordered the same guitar and gotten a dog - malformed fretwork being a particular complaint, and just the thing to kill speed picking.

2411,"Has anyone mounted this on a DSLR or ""bridge"" camera, like the Fujifilm HS50 EXR?","Yes, I did mount it on the DSLR camera.  It works pretty good but certainly not at any distance over about 10-15 feet from the source.  And even at those distances, it is not truly great.....ok, but at 5-10 feet, it is very good."
2412,"How sturdy is it, I am heavy set, but it says 330lbs.I more worried about the back and forth sturdiness. Any and all help appreciated!","I'm 190lbs and I get the feeling it easily could support twice that.  It is very sturdy and well built.  It is perfectly stable in the back and forth direction.  I don't think you could tip it back or forward even if you tried (if you're actually sitting on it).  I use it on carpet an it is still very stable.  You'll be happy with it, it is a great bench."
2413,Can it be connected to the tv (in) if the tv is connected to a sound bar (out) so I can do karaoke?,You need an amplified speaker to connect your shure micro
2414,What type of power plug? US/EU,US type power plug.
2415,Is this effects mixer good for Karaoke?,"Yes, there are 99 effects on the mixer. I use it for karaoke and for my instruments. Here's a list of the effects. http://www.soh.cz/data_images/Image/pronajem/manual/XENYX-1202FXcz.PDFI recommend it if it's for family get togethers and parties. I really enjoy it."
2416,"Does it have a pendulum? Picture does not show it, if it does.","Yes, it does."
2417,is a cromatic scale ?,Yes. It's chromatic from A3 to E5.
2418,How is the sound compared to TUSQ? I'm looking for the warmest sound with the best sustain. I don't like bright high tones.,"I have never used Tusq, so I can't be of any help. I have tried the Martin ebonys on my recording king, and I can't tell any difference from the factory pins, but that could be different if someone else was listening. I can tell you that the Martin pins are very high quality, and the accuracy of manufacture is very, very nice.  rf"
2419,"I'm a left handed player, can the chord finder be switched to a left handed chord chart?","I play right handed and use the Qwik Tune for tuning the strings mostly, but it does not appear to be able to switch to cords for left handed playing."
2420,Can you adjust each channel (left/right) separately?,"No, it's a simple equalizer I use for my headphones. It would be nice but @ this price it works well for what I need it to do."
2421,It is ok for a tall 9 years old?,"Sort of...I bought this for my 3 year old last year. His sister is 9 this year and she's about 4'8"" (she's talk too) and she still plays them...but they look kind of small when she is sitting and playing. They are a really nice set though, much better than anything out there for the price. To even get close it was almost 2x the price! Hope that helps!"

But, despite this pretty serious shortcoming, I do like the basic design and features of the bag more than most gig bags I've had. They just should NOT run the zipper along the bottom, it's useless to do that anyway. Hope this helps...

2432,does it have knot for strap?,"Sorry no knots for a strap. Classical guitars don't have them, they are designed to be held different than a regular acoustic guitar."
2433,Is this unit loud enough for use at beach wedding with 60 guests?,As long as the wind isn't blowing too hard.  Seriously it is pretty loud!
2434,Can it be just used as a regular mic? Just plug into the wall sockets and use as a mike on stage and not as a karoke accessorry?,It needs to be plugged into some kind of amp like a karaoke machine or speaker. It cannot be plugged into a wall socket.
2435,How well do they hold up hitting crash cymbals and not just drums?,My girl has used them for normal set play without issue. We've had them since July and they still work fine
2436,Does this bag have any padding whatsoever?,"It is padded, not overly so but adequately, and has two large pockets to store accessories, music, etc.  I'm very pleased.  It's fits my PX-350 perfectly."
2437,Is this made in China?,"My assumption is yes, it's just cheep plastic and not all that good. If you are interested in learning/playing the ocarina and still want plastic, take a look at the ocarina listed here. http://www.stlocarina.com/ztenorpldis.html"
2438,Does this unit have a built in drum machine?,You have to connect one to it with 1/4 inch jack in back of unit.
2439,Is this compatible Mt. Lion?,Yes. Best keyboard I've owned if you're using Logic Pro or reason on a Mac. No issues at all. Well worth the investment.
2440,will this replace the neede on Crosley CR6249A-TA ?,I think it most likely will. I purchased it for my Crosley CR6249A (mine does not have the -TA) and it works fine. I'm just not sure how different the -TA makes yours.
2441,Does this unit come with the measurement microphone? or would I have to buy one separately?,When you buy a new unopened unit from an authorized dealer it includes a measurement microphone. It does not include a mic cable so have one handy.
2442,Is the 20 gauge / third string wound or unwound?,Wound.
2443,Does this mic come with a cable to connect it to the PC? Or the cable has to be purchased separately?,There was no cable with my purchase of the AKG 170 - There was a carrying case and a microphone holder to mount it onto a mic stand and that was it.

Show Less",the mod wheel will not give you a true leslie sound...I do have the behringer and it is ok...I mean it's 50 bucks so it's not going to sound like a rotosphere or a quality pedal but it does the job....i would say spend the 50 bucks...if you are a true gear head it would not be the first time you bought something that didn't quite sound like you expected...but if you don't buy it you will never know
2445,will the Ion ICTO4 needle fit a Stanton,"Yes, but it also depends what type of Stanton turntable you have."
2446,What type of strings on this ukulele?,"I don't know what kind of strings they are, but I can tell you that once they get stretched out to hold a tune they actually sound pretty good.  I did buy some aquilla's for backups, but I haven't used them yet and I am really enjoying them so far. Had it about a month and a half.  Really good quality instrument for the money by the way."
2447,I noticed that there is another place to plug in something next to the rca outputs.how can both play something?whatcablesdoineedtohavethemupandworking,"The inputs/outputs are (from left to right): Input 1 - stereo plug, Input 2 - R and L phono plugs, Output - connection plug to left speaker, AC Power. On the front there are inputs for a mic and for headphones, as well as volume and balance controls and on-off power switch."
2448,What is the pole diameter and the weight of the base?,The weight is 6.45 lbs and pole diameter at microphone's end is 5/8 inches and base end is 7/8 inches.
2449,Can it be used with upright piano?,"It can be used anywhere it can be clipped onto something.  I use it on my music stand and clip it onto my sheet music binder.  Works great and better than many ""book"" reading lights that I've tried in the past."
2450,weighted,"Yes, the keys are weighted.  They feel a bit heavy for me, as I have gotten so used to 'pseudo-weighted' keyboards like a korg trinity."
2451,Will a Ibanez AC240 fit,"Yes, it fits perfectly. I bought the SKB 000 case for my Ibanez AC240."
2452,"I have an 8x8 size studio, what size KRK monitors would be proper for this size of studio?. Thank You","The krk 5s are best suit for you. Small studio= small monitors. But trust me, the sound from these aren't small!"
2453,How big is this toy?,"about 6.5"" in diameter - the size of a dessert plate.  Easy for small hands to hold!"
2454,Does this actually come with the shelves?    Or is it just the black unit?  Because above it looks like people had to also buy the shelves separately.,It comes with pipes that act like shelfs. Two to a row that the LPs sit on quite nicely enough.
2455,will this fit a 2014 Epiphone 50th 1964 Caballero acoustic?,"Mine fits a 1964 Guild parlor guitar snugly.  You actually have to compress the foam a little with your hand when inserting the Guild, but its not so tight that it would hurt anything.  It is a very high quality case."
2456,"Im seriously about to buy this. Just one question: On how many pc's can i put it on if i buy? If more than one, i'm buying it as soon as i read the answer",I think you can register 3. I'm positive that you can register 2. I have it on my desktop and laptop. Toontrack's licensing and user area is extremely user friendly.
2457,what is the length and width of mount bracket,"16 1/2 inches in length, 2 inches in width and 17 3/4 depth from the wall."
2458,Does this particular item come with a wireless remote or do I have to purchase one separately?,"You can NOT use a wireless remote for this item.    It is either ""on"", or ""off"", with the master power switch.    There is NO place to plug in a wireless remote, or any type of remote.    It's not like a fog machine that has an external controller. Your only option is to create your own power switch that turns the power on/ off.  (Or unplug the extension cord going to the device.)Note:  This thing works great and does make a LOT of bubbles.   The (2) fans are quiet, so it creates minimal noise.  (1) Gallon of bubble fluid lasts about 2 to 3-hours of bubble blowing too.Clean-up for storage is a little effort and messy, but well worth it, for the bubble fun.

2459,will this work for a viola?,http://www.lrbaggs.com/forum/showthread.php?196-Does-Did-L-R-Baggs-make-a-pick-up-for-Viola
2460,Does this work with commercial camcorders like Canon or solely with sony products?,You can use with any camcorder that has mini plug input. Is a good mic
2461,The price on this item i saw it last week at $399....why is it today $549????,"ours has always been 549.00, maybe somebody else had one at 399.00, but it probably wasn't new..."
2462,Would it fit a cutout jumbo? Like the Epiphone AJ-100CE?,"Don't know what size Epiphone AJ-100CE is but it fits my full size classical guitar + plenty of room for music sheets, metronome and almost everything."
2463,"Anyone have any experience with this guitar and any Schecter shapes? Namely the Blackjack ATX, or Hellraiser, or similarly shaped axes?",I use it for my Fender Strats or my Ibanez RG when it's inconvenient to tort a bulky hard shell case to a jam session.  Don't own any Schecters though.  I can say that it is a top quality case that provides more protection than a regular gig bag.
2464,Can this unit control more thann one device at a time?,I believe only in a daisy chain situation
2465,are these necessary to use boss-dd7 ?,"Im not sure i understand your question. You need two cables for any single pedal. One from the pedal to the guitar, and one from the pedal to the amp. These short jumper cables can be used inbetween pedals when your running more than one pedal."
2466,are they sold as a pair?,You can buy two of them.  I've only seen them sold individually.  Good speakers.
2467,Do the Boss ME-70 Guitar Multi-Effects Pedal include the power adapter?,"Sorry but no, but just to let you know I got my ME 70 about 3 mounts ago and I love it. For the price there great, it was like having a nee guitar all over again. The power adapter is not that much, I thinkyou well like the ME70."
2468,I'm traveling out of the country and need a hardshell case for my Lanakai ck-c. Will this fit?,"It should work fine as the case is for a standard size concert Uke, and your Lanikai is standard size concert uke. These cases are pretty well constructed."
2469,does it come with a speaker?,yes a very good speaker.
2470,Does this mixer have the hiss issue if you use it as an output audio interface (computer > mixer > DI) for live situations?,"Yes, don't buy it.  I am returning mine.  Such a disappointment."
2471,What mic would work better for a room filled with people? I want to mic for skype or hangout for a workshop of 10-30 people.,"We use the MXL AC404 for exactly this purpose, with about 30 people. The main factors to consider are the positioning and reverberation. This mic does an excellent job with either Skype, Hangouts, Flash Media Encoder, whatever."
2472,Does the Shure PG42 USB require any additional power aside from what's provided by a PC USB port?,No ... I am really happy with my decision to buy this mic. Excellent quality.
2473,Will this bag work for my Mackie thump 15s?,I think so! I use these for jbl EON515xts and it is a perfect fit! I think the Mackie thump is a little smaller so you should be fine. These covers are great!
2474,what to look for in a clip tuner?,"I only looked for a couple of things - good reviews and the flexibility to turn the display in ways that made it easy to read, regardless of the way in which I was holding the guitar. The Korg had both. I bought it. I haven't been disappointed in any way at all."
2475,Does the violin come assembled or do you have to put it together once it comes?,"You need to install the bridge easy job, tuning will then be next but you should purchase a bottle of liquid rosin for the tuning pegs. Tension on the strings will cause the pegs to loosen but the rosin will give great results, available at any music store about 8.00 lasts for a long time."
2476,"Haven't played trumpet in 30 years. Is this a good beginner to intermediate instrument? If not, which brand is good?","I bought this for my beginning music student.  It's very easy to use.  Lightweight, but quality instrument. Very pleased with my purchase."
2477,are the pegs ebony,The pegs are made of ebony.

2479,"Hi, is this compatible with my Entertech ET 19k wireless Magin Sing Machine?","Yes, this is compatible with your microphone."
2480,"Does the wire have memory, ie, is it hard to straighten?",It is easily straightened by clamping one end in a vise and twisting 3-4 twists per inch with pliers or vise-grips while pulling it straight.
2481,"In addition to my earlier question, are there any additional items like a carrying bag, tuner etc that come with this guitar?",Just the guitar. I bought a strap with a neck strap as it only has the bottom strap button.
2482,Is the book plate made of ferrous metal ?  In other words can I use magnets to hold sheets still on it ?,"Hi Legs That Need Shaving:  I do not have a magnet to test the plate, but you really don't need any magnets.  The stand has two spring loaded clips, one on the bottom of each side.  They do a good job of holding things in place whether it be a single sheet or a book.  It also comes with another (much heavier) spring loaded clip that attaches to the top and holds books in place.  I have two of these stands and just love them.  They are easily adjusted in almost any direction and you never have to worry about them tipping over because of the wide and sturdy base.  Hope this helps."
2483,can this mic get the sound when it is not close to your mounth,"Yes. I have used it for years to clip onto the subjects' shirt or jacket. Works great. These do pickup some sound from the environment. If you're look for something more directional to not pickup environmental sound, you may want a reporter's mic like an MD42."
2484,I live in CA.  Shall I get G3-A or B or G?  I am using it in my media room for Karaoke singing,"This is irrelevant if you have only one system, the selections of frequencies A, B or G are so you can have systems that work in separate frequency bands from each other. If you have only one option to do so has the frequency range more."
2485,What about the supply adaptor?  Does it come with the US 110 V or the standard European 230 V AC  plug?,"Dear Jakub,I got mine couple of months ago and there was a 230V AC adaptor with 2 US and UK plug convertor inside the box. Besides you can use it with no adapter plugged because the Firewire already can provide enough voltage for device. Plus recent packages, Including the one i got, are already included a Firewire 800 to 400 convertor so no need to buy one. :)"
2486,does it have a jack for a microphone?,"There's a ""guitar in"" on the front panel.  In the back is ""headphones out"", RJ45 ""pedal"" jack and ""CD/Mic in"" mini jack.  The 150 units have two speaker out jacks (L/R) as well."

Show Less","While the previous poster actually gave the correct answer, about testing them out at a music store before buying any certain model, that doesn't really answer your question. I recently bought the PX-130 for an ultra-portable ""Grab-N-Go"" piano to use while studying for my Masters. I wanted a full 88 keys, rather than 76 which is typically the next step down. I wanted just the basics, which fit right in with the other 2 requirements I set .... those being, as stated above, portability, and I also didn't want to spend a fortune for something which will see only limited use in very specific circumstances. The lack of every extra gadget, gizmo, & neat-o known to man on the PX-130 keeps it light & inexpensive, for a win-win situation for me. Note that I DID have prior experience on the PX-130 and knew it was a quality instrument. But I may have bought it anyway without the prior experience, since I know by research & word-of-mouth that it would fit my needs. Basically, the YPG-535 is going to cost you 50-100 $$ more than the PX-130 from the same supplier. You may find the 535 cheaper at Supplier #1 than the 130 is at Supplier #2. But then if you search for the 130 at the same Supplier #1, most of the time it'll be cheaper than the Yamaha. That price difference is almost solely because the Yamaha has several more features than the Casio. But those extra features are typically stuff you'll rarely use, since both instruments have pretty much everything you'll need for most ""normal"" music. If your situation requires more gadgetry than the 130 has, then you'll almost certainly have to jump up to a higher level, much more expensive tier of instrument. The Yamaha can't do THAT much more than the Casio. The Casio is quite a bit lighter also, by several pounds. And it is also somewhat smaller in all dimensions than the Yamaha. The Yamaha has 4 speakers, as compared to the Casio. The 2 largest speakers on each are practically identical, but the Yamaha adds 2 tiny tweeters. Curiously however, the amplifier on the Casio is slightly more powerful. Customer reviews for both, no matter where you look, are practically identical .... Very Satisfied or Very Good. That is expected because they are both quality instruments.  Probably the BIGGEST difference, which COULD be a major one depending upon individual, personal preference, is that the Yamaha has a propietary type of key response called ""Graded Soft Touch"". It's a bit hard to explain the difference (this is an example of where that in-store test-drive pays off), but it's NOT the same as the more common ""Weighted Scaled Hammer Action"" that the Casio offers. To me, the plain 'ole WSHA of the Casio is much more like a true piano than the GST of the Yamaha. But as already mentioned, this could VERY easily be a completely personal preference. Some may think the Yamaha's keys are more like a true piano. Bottom-line, if you are wanting a basic digital piano, I'd go with the Casio. I don't think the little ""extras"" provided by the Yamaha really make up for the medium price difference. But if basic is what you need/want, or simply super-portable as in my case, you won't go wrong with either model. If you need/want an instrument that is truly better & has more features, then the Yamaha won't satisfy that requirement over the Casio .... they are too much alike. In that case, you'd just have to write off BOTH of them & jump up to a more expensive bracket.

The bench is not,  It isn't necessary, since you adjust the stand to suit the bench. The seat is very thickly padded, sturdy and comfortable.  Was pleasantly satisfied with them both, especially given the inexpensive price.  Would highly recommend it."

They will repeat of course making jamming possible. However it's extremely essy to add your CDs or even songs input analog from any sound source. I like youtube and input those all the time for learning them. You can play along, slow/speed/fine tune pitch, etc. this is a great machine and I still use it regularly. And yes you get a menu, not always the easiest to find but once you get the hang of where and how to find it, it's effective..not perfect but effective."

This guitar needs frequent retuning, so an older student developing a musical ear without an instructor to tune the guitar may be frustrated. 3/4 or just small body models might be better.

COPYSTAR has other models with additinal trays that will make several copies, instead or just one, at the same time, but these models are more expensive. You decide."
2502,Is there a USB port to connect a computer for music?,No USB port.  You need a auxiliary cable (not included).  You plug it into the headphone jack.
2503,"Does the wire have memory, ie, is it hard to straighten?",It is easily straightened by clamping one end in a vise and twisting 3-4 twists per inch with pliers or vise-grips while pulling it straight.
2504,Can this be easily used in Australia with 240v power supply? What would I need?,Yes sir it sure can be used globally . 100-240v ~ 50/60hz 180w fuse: t 3.15A H 250V
2505,Will these fit a Gibson Les Paul Future Tribute?,It fit my Les Paul 50's Tribute.
2506,"What are the differences between Tube and Solid States? Basically, the question is in the title.  I'm an acoustic guitarist of 5 years, and have limited experience with sound equipment or amplification.  So I was curious about difference - I.E. Wattage, Sounds, Size, Cabinets - Anything that you think is important to know about purchasing a guitar amp.  Thanks in advance guys.

Show Less","Tubes need to be changed when there is a difference in the sound and in general every year anyway to make sure they don't fail on you. Transistors never need to be changed unless they burn or a bad short in the circuitry of the amp is encountered. But if that happens for the most part the entire amp is fried. Tubes have a natural compression and smooth creamy distortion when pushed at higher volumes. Transistors are clean no matter how loud the volume is set unless there is a master control. A tube amp of 15 watts can normally out volume a transistor amp of up to 50 watts and even more though this depends on tube amp manufacturer and condition of tubes. I've had them all from a 1965 VOX AC30 to a 100watt Galien Krueger 212G transistor amp that I used for 2 decades. Now I use a VOX AC15C1 with an Epiphone Casino and I get creamy distortion, amazing string feedback, tonal and sensitivity range that I could never get with the Gallien that I used for rock bands with A LOT of pedals. You being an acoustic player may prefer the clean transistor sound which is not inferring tube amps can't be clean but as the volume goes up the natural distortion also does except for Ampegs which stay clean until your ears bleed.

2507,It says Guitar System. How different it would work with a keyboard/synthesizer or electric violin?,And as such is monophonic and with a narrower spectrum than that of a synthesizer...
2508,What size is the guitar?,"It is full sized. The neck is about 25"" long."
2509,Is this model the 'AI' Version?,"No,It's not the 'AI' Version"
2510,Do the speakers come with stand adapters built in?,Yes. The speakers can be mounted to either mic stands or traditional speaker stands. The adapter is included.
2511,"The product description states that it is a handheld wireless microphone system, yet the pictures show a headset wireless microphone system.  Which?","Its a 2 headset piece. We bought ours 2 years ago. They are still working great, we use them on Sundays in our kids church...i love them...great sound and range...i would buy them again. Highly reccomend this product...very satisfied"
2512,is power suply 220v,"It's both 110v. and 220v. simultaniously. This means it can be used in USA, Canada and Europe without any volt converter or anything. Hope this helps."
2513,can this hook up to any amplifiers or speakers?,"The microphones transmit to a receiver which has a 1/4 inch phone socket.  A chord with a 1/4 inch plug on each end will connect between this receiver to an audio amplifier.  You cannot connect this receiver to a RCA type amplifier since the impedance is different, you would need a converter."
2514,is this a good saxophone for my son starting 6th grade band the school seems to think some of the cheaper bran please let me know if this will be good,"We bought this sax for our 6th grader, knowing it wasnt a recognized name in instruments. I have had at least 3 music teachers look it over and tell us that we got a great deal. The tone of the instrument is fabulous. it is a great student instrument."
2515,In between the slimpar 38s and slimpar 56s... Recommendations?,"Hi.  I have the slim par 56, and I love them.  We run 8 of them for music performances, 4 on each side of the stage.  Honestly, between the two, you are looking at brightness, because the slim size already takes care of portability and space issues.  I would hesitate to use the 38s for our application, because there are times where I wish the 56s were brighter.  If you are using them for ambient light and color rather than your sole source of illumination, I would think either one would be fine.  Hope this helps!"
2516,is the body plastic?,The top is spruce with a composite body...do not let that discourage you. This guitar sounds like a Martin. The quality is awesome and it is more durable and less expensive.I use mine for studio recording using a mic. The pickups are o.k. but the guitar sounds much better using a good mic.
2517,I have a Seagull S6 spruce and a Teton STS105 cedar and mahogany.  How will this compare?  I'm looking for warm deep and mellow sounds.,"That's difficult to answer. IMO this guitar's greatest strengths are the pickups but the acoustic sound, construction and playablility are still well above average. Best thing is to go to your local dealer to demo it and then decide. See my review dated January 10, 2014."
2518,Will this amp keep up with a drummer unmiked?,"It does for me, but I do have a small volume boost from my pedal board. I promise you, it is the best $100 you will ever spend. I have two close friends who are incredible guitar players, and they both bought one, and they love it."
2519,is it god quality,"not quite 'god' quality, but quite good."
2520,What is the length of the flute?,"The low D flute is 23 inches long, and truly beautiful."
2521,Will this fit on a Squire Standard Fender Strat?,"Hi, yes, it will fit. I put it into a Squier Standar Fender Strat. Wiring was simple. Pickups sound great.Many greetings, R.-B."

That's how Yamaha etc. make their bloody money! :) They always put a warning that you MUST buy only Yamaha adapter (of course ways overpriced!), saying that any after market adapter may damage the device :) Happily one of my external hard drives died right when I bought this keyboard and since then I use its power adapter with the keyboard with no problem. It has the same specs and works just fine."
2523,How tall does it go?,"I sent mine back because it didn't fit my dulcimer, but if my memory serves me correctly it was only a couple of feet tall. It would sit on a tabletop well."
2524,Is the black a glossy black or matte black? I'm wondering how easy it is to keep fingerprint smudges off of the body.,glossy black
2525,What battery does it use?,"I had to return mine, the switch quit working after 2 studio sessions"
2526,What app do you download on your laptop? Can you use a Toshiba for this specific app? What laptop would you prefer?,"The app you download is from virtualdj.  Contact Numark or Virtualdj if you need any help with this.The app on the provided CD, does not work and the Manual does NOT cover the Mixtrack unit specifically.Yes you can use a Toshiba, that is what I am using.  I am also using it on an Acer.Laptop is your choice, not mine, but I do agree with the first responder.A Side comment. If you have looked at the reviews of the unit on You Tube, ignore them totally they will discourage you rather than encourage you.  I am a total amateur and so far I have been learning by discovery and not by any manual.  This unit -to me at least- contains many fantastic effects and controls.

2527,Does this have a tube or a solid state rectifier? If it's tube then which tube is it?,SS rectifier
2528,Is there a travel case for this karaoke machine?,Not that I know of...It's a floor model.  Relatively large.  Not something I would move around a lot.
2529,Would this guitar suit smaller hands?,"I bought this for a lady friend. She is about 5' 4"" and has small hands. She doesn't seem to have any problems with the neck size. It has a fairly slim neck."
2530,should I buy this,Yes!!!!
2531,how does this sound unpluged ?,"This guitar is a steal at the price.  Good sound and good tone and a good fit.  Am very pleased with this Jameson guitar.  Haven't tried it through an amp yet, but sounds great acoustically."
2532,Is  it compatible with iPod classic,Yes.  You can read a review of the product as used on an iPod Classic here: http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-player-accessories/blue-microphones-mikey/4505-6519_7-33529087.html
2533,Does this keyboard work alone or does it have to be plugged into a computer? (Can you just plug it into the wall and play?),"It needs to be plugged into a computer, hooked to either a DAW or plugin with MIDI support. It can't be used by itself."
2534,when you press the power button does the sound fade off?,There is no power button.
2535,Are the keys weighted?,"As answered before; yes, the keys are weighted and feel and respond very realistically compared to an acoustic piano. (IMHO)  For the money, it is an amazing digital piano. You get a whole lot of bang for your buck!"
2536,Can a use a standard 3.5mm plug on these? How do they sound with compressed music?,"If memory serves correctly these are 1/4"" but come (original stock) with adapters to the standard 1/8"" on phones/aux-input devices, or vice-versa.  I'm sorry I can't be certain, but in general adapters are great to have around.  They are ""flat"" monitors so compressed (lo-fi) will be more noticeable because the headphones present sound more accurately.  I used these for a couple years and only gripe is the squeeze on the head. Great for making music (due to accuracy) but if you just want to listen they show the wrinkles.  Having a great pair of headphones is double-edged:  On one hand you can hear everything, on the other you can hear EVERYTHING, so low quality recording or compression will bug.

2539,Can anyone recommend  a bow? I'm an electric bass guitar player looking to have some fun with a new and different instrument.,"For having fun, this bow is pretty rugged, and does a pretty good job. I bought a carbon fiber double bass [url=http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Mongolia-Horsehair-French-Carbon/dp/B00BRACFS2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1418413292&sr;=8-2&keywords=carbon+fiber+double+bass+bow#customerReviews [/url] bow to play on my gigs. The Mongolian black horse hair is finer to me than regular horse hair and plays well. The bow itself is almost bulletproof. I've lost fewer hairs than expected, so the build quality seems excellent. The tightening mechanism is relatively fast, which I appreciate, and doesn't lose tension. As standard technique, don't forget to loosen the bow when you're done so all the hairs don't pull out when you're not playing. The tip has a little turned-up nose, which you can sometimes use for a special, tiny sound effect. The width of the hairs is wider than some bows, so getting the string to vibrate at first is a little easier, which makes you sound more professional. A major factor will be choosing the perfect rosin, which I still haven't found. Lots of good rosins out there however. YMMV. As of Dec 2014, Amazon has one for $103.99 after shipping. You can spend less, and you can spend a whole lot more.

2540,Can you recommend a mic stand to use with this? I have read it is heavy and so my boom mic stand does not sound like it will work.,I use a mic stand with a round base to hold it and then use a boom stand with a boom arm extension to hang my mic down
2541,Does this MIC need a special Cable or any normal MIC cables with XLR pins can be used?,"It will work with a regular XLR cable. All of the sound techs I have dealt with since purchase say that in spite the TC-Helicon having built in settings for this mic, and it having the effect on/off switch on it, that they much prefer that I use a regular Shure Beta microphone."
2542,Does the preamp on this one from Amazon have a dynamics knob? The same guitar on ZZounds has a preamp with a dynamics slider.,It has knobs and not sliders.
2543,Does it have a good piano sound?,"This Keyboard features synthetic/Grimy/Gritty and techno sounds.  There isn't a single normal/classical instrument on it, its not intended for that, however you can use it as a great Midi keyboard with Ableton which has dozens of different types of piano sounds.  For the price, its perfect for sparking ideas for electronic music, lots of weird and cool stuff on here and you can Tweak every single thing on it.

2544,does it have a music holder?,"The Roland RD-300NX does not have a music stand, but you can buy stands for the keyboard that can double as music stands."
2545,My cajon has a pick-up installed and I plug it into my bands board.  How would this work with one set up like this?  Similar to acoustically miked?,I doubt it will change the sound from your pickup at ll. it's an acoustic enhancement.
2546,is it easy to play this item.,It is not a musical instrument. It is a CASE for a mandolin. So I guess it would be hard to play.
2547,Can two strings be used together off one controller for 32 feet?,Yes the can be. And you can also cut every 3 leds to extend or do 90 dagree turns or extend over areas you do not want lit.
2548,"Are the notes engraved on the keys, or are they stickers on the keys?",They are engraved.
2549,Does this device come with a power supply?,"Yes, it does"
2550,Where is this product made?,"I'm at work so I ca't double check, but I am almost positive it was Israel. I remember because it seemed like an unusual place, but I was glad it wasn't China."
2551,good for ipod or iphone 5?,"iPod docks just fine. If iPhone 5 has a different pin size, then you will probably need to get an adapter with the RCA audio plugs."
2552,"Will this work as a guitar tuner as well?  (received as a Christmas gift, but it's the uke version instead of guitar)","Yes it will tune a guitar, but it won't tuna fish."
2553,Can you suggest a light weight & compact speaker stand that is between 50 & 60 inches & easy to carry?,"Pyle-pro Pstk103 Heavy-duty Aluminum Anodizing Dual Speaker Stand With Traveling Bag Kit (here at amazon). Not the best but lightweight, easy to carry and affordable ($64.95). Holds speakers up to 100 pounds. In the other hand, Guitar Center has really good quality stands (not lightweight but durable)."
2554,How much weight will this hold vertically mounted on glass?,The velcro itself will never let go- I could see it holding as much as 35 pounds.  The problem is the backing adhesive.  It will peel off before the velcro will making this stuff not much more useful then double sided tape.
2555,Is this a hard case? What color is the case? Thanks!,This kit did not come with a case. Only a soft bag.
2556,Is this a good size for a 10-year old to sit on her bed and play with? Or is it more or a desk thing?,I personally find it more comfortable on a solid surface but it would fit ok on a bed for entertainment.  Proper posture and hand position wouldn't be reinforced in that regard but if just for entertainment I am certain that it would work fine.
2557,is an ipod needed,No iPod needed.  It just plugs into the wall and you're good to go.  My kids love it! (Ages 4 & 6)
2558,what is the voltge in 220 or 110 v ?,it has a IEC cable on it. just looked and on the back panel it says 115-230V 50/60hz. so if you have a IEC with the correct plug for your country you should be all good. mine shipped with a US IEC plug. a plug adapter alone should work.
2559,"The description says maple neck, but the picture shows rosewood. Does this guitar have a rosewood neck or maple neck?",The Oscar Schmidt OE20G has a maple neck and a rosewood fretboard.
2560,are these pick-ups active? I have a c-1 platinum with active emg's and was thinking of trying passive,Passive Duncan
2561,does it have storage under the seat,"The Ebony Adjustable Artist Piano Bench has under-seat storage, which measures 11.5"" x 19.75"" x 2.0."""
2562,hi how bring out my bass behringer mixer 2442fx connect to behringer nu3000 and speakers i get no bass from speakers at all so please help me thank,Flip the crossover switch on the back. It should be in the middle.
2563,can you use two karaoke microphones at the same time?,"Not directly. There is one XLR input for a microphone, and the other inputs are RCA-style, not 1/4"" plugs used for instruments or some microphones. Also, phantom power is only provided though the XLR input, so only one non-self powered microphone will work with the mixer."
2564,Does the gig bag come with an over the shoulder strap?,"Yes, the gig bag does come with a detachable shoulder strap. The strap comes inside the case and attaches to sewn-in D-rings on the outside of the case. The case is actually REALLY nice, good quality!"
2565,Are the keys accurately in tune?  Can this be played in an ensemble?,I just tried hitting a chromatic scale while holding a tuner next to it. It appears to depend on how I hit it and which mallets are used. It was generally within 10 cents of an equal temperament scale although I hit some sour tones when I wasn't careful about hitting the center. Almost no reverb on it so I don't think it would clash in an ensemble.
2566,"Would you get this one, or would you prefer the epiphone dot?  I'm trying to decide between the two?  How do you like it?","The Epiphone Dot has a larger Body size than the Epi ES-339 with less features... the ES-339 has a bound Rosewood Fret-Board & ""push-pull"" Volume Control to turn the Epiphone '57 Classic Humbucker Pick-Ups into Single Coil (Coil Tap). Very comfortable guitar to play, with great tones, nice features & ""fit-finish"" is great for the $$$$   I ALSO OWN THE GIBSON ES-339 (which I love) but find myself picking up the Epiphone ES-339."
2567,When you set the color with the controller and then turn on and off the power to the light from a switch will the light keep it's color setting ???,"Yes.    It will  keep the color until you change  it with a remote.   looking at the other answers, I guess we got lucky.   we bought in two segments and have over twenty and they all keep the color."
2568,Will this fit a DDJ-T1?,"My DDJ-SX fits so it should fit the DDJ-T1, but compare the specs just to make sure."
2569,Are the strings steel or nylon?,"The strings are steel with a wood guitar. I ordered it for my five year old grandaughter,we were amazed how awesome it is. My son is going to wait a couple years and have her take lessons. She LOVED it, but just strums it now. Really was a couple steps up from what i thought i was getting. Very nice for the price."
2570,"do you plug this directly into your computer, or into one of the microphone ports of your audio interface? thanks",I plug into the usb port of my computer.
2571,"i need to know how to mout the pick up bar,  have got everything cut and fit,  but had no  instructions how to mount the pick up bar","Did you watch the video that Andrew Morrish uploaded? It goes through everything very well, in a step by step fashion. You can see it here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/mpd/permalink/m3DR515NZF7PTZ/ref=cm_ciu_vr_mo1USC295DFF64X"
2572,I can connect in the same area and the same time these three microphones : 45a; 45B and 45C ? Ie those can be used simultaneously in the same area thr,Yes
2573,Is this suitable for beginners who have no experience with drumming? (No experience but i'm passionate about learning!),Definitely.  It's very easy to use.  You have to hit it center to get great sound.  Pedals slip but you can put some anti slip material to stop from sliding. I bought it for my girlfriend as she wants to learn and she loves it.
2574,What is the maximum extent of the mic stand?,Under 2ft
2575,are these or m50's better????,Depends on what you want. I like my pro500mk2 but i believe they have better lows. If you want highs go with the m50's if you want bass go with the pro500mk2's
2576,Is there are manual I can download for this product. I am afraid to spend that much money when there is such little information about it.,"Hello, yes you may download the manual by clicking this link:  ftp://ftp.steinberg.net/Download/Hardware/UR824/UR824_OperationManual_en.pdf Please let us know if you have any further questions,Thank you,AngelmiYRS MIDI"
2577,Do these have good bass and sound quality?,Decent bass and great clarity in the mids and highs I
2578,"Will this book work with a soprano uke, or only a baratone?","This was the book we were recommended to use for our soprano and concert ukes. I don't know about baritone, though."
2579,Is this appropriate for taking on an airplane?,"This is a soft case, so I don't think I would use it for an airplane."
2580,I have an Epiphone Joe Pass emperor II...will it fit in this case?,no the clx is for classical guitars not 355s or dreadnaughts
2581,will this fit a epiphone wildkat?,Had to make larger holes in the body for a 2012 Les Paul Studio. Worth the effort tho.
2582,Do you have to buy a separate cable to connect guitar to computer?,No.  It comes with the USB cable that plugs into the computer.
2583,Where was this guitar made?,"I think it is assembled in Mexico, but all US Fender parts."
2584,does it comes with a power supply,"No. USB provides 5 volts. If using with midi port instead of usb, you need power supply."
2585,I am going to purchase this juke for my hubby as a Christmas gift. can someone tell me what adapter I need to buy to go with this? We have an I phone 5 and a I pad 2  thanks for the help,"the aux input doesn't exactly work so well on the jukebox, unless its just a problem with mine i can never get it to work. try finding an adapter that has an input of the old apple plugs and then an output of the new lightening plug, then you can get the bonus of charging your devices as well"
2586,Can this be used for Karaoke?,"It would depend on the size of the room and the quality of the Karaoke input signal; This speaker says it is rated at 300 Watts RMS but it just doesn't sound as loud as other active speakers with that RMS wattage. For a small room @ 3/4 max volume, it should be just fine."
2587,Will this work on iPad air with an adaptor?,Yes
2588,Is it a good size for an extremely tall 12 year old (I'm 5'4'')?,It really is a good size. Although this is my first guitar I'm not a expert in sizes. But it's perfect for me since I'm 5'3
2589,Any recommendations on how to set it up once you receive it? How to install bridge? No instructions or suggestions were included.,I received the package properly boxed woth no damage. It only comes with what is shown in the photos so I used youtube as my guide on how to set up the brigde and the bow. The cello itself is great. However I suggest you get a proper bow.
2590,is this safe to plug in to an Extension Cord?,"Yes, works perfectly fine!"
2591,"What is the maximum adjustable height of the lighting stand?Also, what is the wattage for the individual LED? 1 watt? 3 watts?","Included stand is a 9ft light stand. We suggest safest use at 7-8 feet.LED power is not published, but they appear to be the same 1/4 watt LED's used in the GO series fixtures"
2592,Are there beltloops on this kilt?,Indeed.  There are.
2593,Anyone know approximately how long the batteries last?,"If left on high setting, 8 hours."
2594,Is this made in Germany or China?,"Unlike a lot of the other cheap harmonicas, it appears that this is, in fact, made in Germany."
2595,Where do you find the manufactured date?,"The label contains all vital information to the product. More information may be found molded into the plastic housing on the device. I'm not sure why you'd want to find this, but give the molding a try."
2596,Is this a 1/4 inch or 3mm jack?,It comes with the adapter to give you both options.
2597,Is this Taylor a GS mini or GA? or jumbo ?? or what size is this?,It has a 3/4 scale.  The body might be slightly bigger than some other 3/4 guitars but it is not big enough to produce a big bass sound.
2598,Are these condenser microphones?,Sorry don't know what a t that means
2599,"How heavy is the Microphone ? Will it hurt if my wife hits me with the Microphone ? If so, will how much will it hurt (On a scale of 1 to 10)","The microphones (there are two) are reasonably solid and could easily be used to inflict blunt trauma, especially when used together. As to the extent of the trauma that would depend on your wife's strength and skill."
2600,does this come with the power supply,"Yes indeed it does come with a power cord, and it's also awesome,  do yourself a favor and purchase this thing"
2601,"Has anyone used this w/ sound equipment / & or, synthesizer use? Thanks for ANY help!",This is the one I sent back... it was badly made and didn't stand evenly.  I got this one and love it. On Stage KT7800 Plus Padded Keyboard Bench
2602,"Recently got this mic.. Getting a lot of hissing noise at all settings, with my canon t3i.. (its connected, green light on). Any settings advice?","I had no problem,  you might want to check that the connector is set correct. You might want to play with the settings off your mic also. I will also do a couple of test settings and if I can duplicate the issue I will let you know."
2603,"My son will be turning 8, would this be a good set for him?",Yes. I think it would be very good. I bought it for my 50 year old husband. It has everything for a beginner.
2604,"Hello,  Would a 3/4 violin fit in this stand?",Probably not.
2605,"How do you attatch it to vertical surfaces?  Does it require close adherence to a wall, floor, etc, or can it float with some air space between surfaces and still be effective?","i used staple gun to attach directly to beams, then put 1"" raisers ( metal channel) to separate drywall from beams. this gives air space, same on ceiling, but you def need several people as it is very heavy."
2606,"what kind of finish, lacquer, oil...needs to be applied?","I prefer nitro.  This particular neck comes with a light coat of sealer, it is compatible with laquer.  If you reshape the back, and I recommend it because it's a little too thick, you'll burn through it anyway.  After you get the final shape sand it up to 320 grit but just scuff the fret board with Scotch-brite.  Seal the whole thing with Behlens vinyl sealer then scuff it with 320.  If you burn through the vinyl apply another coat.  After that apply 2-3 very light coats of Behlens nitrocellulose lacqer to the fret board (frets and all) and 6-8 coats to the back and head-stock.  If you want a colored finish you can add trans-tint dye to the lacquer to make it a toner.

2607,"Trying to decide between the WK-225, CTK-4200, and CTK-3200 .  Any thoughts?",We bought the WK 225 and love it. It is perfect for what we needed. My daughter is 8 years old and started to take piano lessons. We have had no problems with it. She can switch between her teachers piano and her keyboard without any issues.
2608,could you connect the machine to the computer?,I'm pretty sure you could...we connected to our t.v. Great feature! Sound quality was excellent. There are many features found on much more expensive machines.
2609,Must it remain installed on the computer in order the AU / VST plug-in to work with other programs or can I uninstall it after creating this plug-in?,No it has to stay installed. That way you can use it with the daw that you are using
2610,Does it have to be plugged into the television to use ?  .. can it be plugged into an electrical outlet ?,It can be plugged into an outlet.
2611,it cover good for 55 gallons tank?,It's barely did the job for my 29 gallon
2612,Can I use external amplifiers with this digital piano?,"Yes, we have fed it into the sound system at our local theater for our musical theater production."
2613,How many computers may I install my reason into?  We have three different computers my studio And we need this product in all three Is that going to be possible,"You may install reason on any computer you like, but you can only use it on one computer at a time.  Essentially you need the ""ignition key"" (a small device plugged into the USB port) to use the software, or you can verify by internet, but you cannot have more than one verified session at a time."
2614,I have Jasmin Dreadnought S35. Do you think it would fit my guitar?,"My guess is probably not.  I purchased this gig bag for a Martin D-1 (basic dreadnaught size/shape), and it was too shallow (i.e. wouldn't fit the body of the guitar)."
2615,does guitar have electronics,No
2616,Does it come with a microphone?,yes it does!
2617,"I have a few questions: I am a beginner, is this a good guitar to start with and are steel or nylon strings better? How close are the strings?","Told by guitar teacher, excellent for beginner. Not sure about strings but we replaced. Bought for daughter for Christmas, loves it."
2618,Could you tell me how much does it Weight?,Just barely over 10.5 lbs (4.8kg) It is very lightweight. Hope this helps.
2619,"What very basic items would I need to make sound out of this item? I mean cords, amps, etc. I have never owned one, and do not own an amplifier.","You need something that makes the actual sound, and something to connect this item to your sound producer. There are several ways to do this. The standard way is to get some sort of amplifier, and connect this to that with a 1/4"" instrument cable. If you don't want to buy an amp, and you have a stereo that has RCA inputs (the red & white cables), you could connect this to that stereo with a 1/4"" to RCA audio cable."
2620,Must this mic be used with a transmitter or can it be used on it's own?,"It can be used on its own only if your recording device can supply condenser mic voltage (approximately 3 VDC).  This is an option on many field and portable recorders, as well as many PCs and laptops.  I hope this is what you are asking."
2621,Does this bag fit a full sized electric Fender guitar?,Its Junk. U would be better off with a trash bag and dicta tape. Dont waste your time or money. Size yes it should Fit.  Estimated
2622,will this fit a lespaul epi,Yes
2623,Just received this & am unclear how to use headset without it being plugged in. What setting does the unit need to be on in order to work wirelessly?,"The microphone is ""hands-free"", but does need to be plugged in to the unit. You wear the unit as a belt with the microphone."
2624,will this fit an epiphone les paul 100?,"Yes, in theory. It fits my Tele perfectly, even with its longer-than-normal head. Should fit any LP, SG, Strat, or Tele. Probably Jazzmaster/Jag type bodies as well, but def not V's, Explorers, etc."
2625,how is the wiring set up? I have a pair of yamaha dxr10 connected to my macbook. and I just want some lighting effect for a house party.,All you have to do is locate the Mini Kinta near one of the speakers and set the mode for sound sensitivity. The MK should be pointed at the largest expanse of walls and the room should be as dark as possible.  There is no wiring needed because the MK sequences the lights according the the sound heard by the microphone located in the back of the unit.
2626,for tagalog songs does it comes with chip or its built in?,"Yeah, Built in , some old song Good luck ���"
2627,The end looks different from other plugs i'm used to do I need to buy anything extra,"The supplier has sent you a unit with a European plug in error! Same thing happened to me.  As I travel to Europe, I already had a foreign adapter. I would send unit back. Failing that you will have to spend $6-$10 for travel adapter."
2628,Is is with a CD containing software?,Yes but you will most likely want to use your own.  See my previous posts on this item.
2629,Do I have to build this instrument or does it arrive fully built?,The package comes with step by step assembly instruction and hardware. Screwdriver is not included.
2630,Where do I get instructions? Seems like a bad thing to have to put together without them...,"i built a b004 about a year ago. my first and i dont play, just like woodwork and projects. the kit had no instructions and i could not find any. assume you have all the parts of the kit. then get started. look everything over. get an idea in your head about what this guitar will look like. fit the neck and body together. they may have matching numbers. make sure the neck and body fit perfectly before gluing up. stain or paint the parts before assembly. do not get stain or paint in the joint area of the neck and body. tape it off. tape off the fret board and end nut. now sand and paint. youll be ok. takes a little time.

2631,"Is the light level adjustable on the touch pads, or is it at a constant intensity?","The light levels are adjustable by default on the velocity level of the particular pad. Therefore, if I hit a bright then dark green pad in sequence the first pad would be more touch sensitive and loud. There are also several third party plugins I'm aware of that manipulate the lighting in an incredible way. Overall, everything is designed to ensure that you can control and visually see the details of each pad without looking at your computer."
2632,do i just plug the unit into a regular wall socket and ready to go  with batteries.  where does the jack go?,"There are 3 units(2 microphone and 1 machine). Microphones will run only through 9V Batteries.For other one(Machine),you need to plug it into a regular wall socket.This is for power. There is a audit jack coming out from the machine which is the audio output and that you need to plug to any audio system. Hope this will help!!!!"
2633,Can I use these in any lamp or do I need a special lamp? I want them to accentuate a stage curtain..I need them soom..,You can use this in any standard or regular bulb receptacle or socket. If it is able to meet your expectation that only depends of the size of the area where you want to use it. For me it was more than enough because I'm using it just to create an effect in a small bar (about 20sq ft)
2634,Can the lights be powered off a portable power suppy (batteries).,Yeah they can. I use a 9volt to check my lights....
2635,what type of base is this? it looks like a candlelabra type base....,It screws into any regular light bulb outlet.
2636,Is it include Bench?,"Yes, it does."
2637,Where would I plug in my keyboard/synth on this? The line input or..?,"As someone previously noted , yes, you can use in/out cords from behind-which is definitely fine may be fine for live shows but leave you limited. Their are plenty of adapters out there for conversion to quarter jack (Line-In on both jacks). For recording direct to computer, use the cord that comes with the M-Audio mixer because converts right to USB(and is even  recognized as a device for many studio programs and listed in the drop down menus that ask what your using for speaks, mic, etc.). This way you will allow you access to controls for gain, level, Master, analogue or digital, ability to allow each input to be recorded as either already studio mixed together by selecting stereo, selecting mono on a channel allows each thing plugged in record as single separate tracks to work more on after words with equalization, levels on sound so they can mix everything at the decibel level they want for each instrument and later pan the tracks as they wish to sound hearing back through something else like speakers or headphones,  (I prefer line in the most because I can produce the instruments while hearing it turning the dial halfway to monitor and usb plugging in a good set of headphones. Doing thing this gives the chance to heare how the music you are playing will sound allowing you to make any adjustments or changes needed while hearing what the finished sound that goes to recording will exactly sound on the finished track). From there you can produce with confidence as you pretty much hear the take in real-time. Hope this helps-please let you let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks.

2638,Does this unit come pre-assembled or does it have to be put together?,The unit comes in 2 pieces the wheel ass and the unit itself easy put together
2639,Is there a screen on the mic to scroll through which  shows the syncing?Does the handheld convert to a lav mic?,Yes--You can set the  channel or sync to a group that reads out easy to see.--------No ----The best way to  do the Lav  Mic and the Handheld  is to buy the Combo  BLX unit it works great both with there own  Group settings-- We use it in our Chapel-- Works Great!!
2640,is it a good quality guitar?,Can't complain. Quality kit. Plays pretty good after set up.
2641,"Just curious, what does it sound like if you scream into it for hardcore style music?",it depends on what chord you are fretting as you scream. 7 string guitar may be questionable. The unit works well as long as it can recognize the chord voicing.
2642,"Hi, I´m interested on the ION turntable, but I wanna know if it has the hole to plug earphones?. the pic doesn't show anything. thx","It has an audio output in the back, but that looks like it's for additional speakers, not head phones. We haven't tried head phones and we can't find the information booklet."
2643,Can you get a white light look?,No I don't think so. But this is a nifty little light. We had a New Years party with 50 people dancing in our living room and this little light MADE the party. People are still asking me about it.
2644,Is it one case for two speakers or a case for each speaker,The price you see is for only one case (for only one speaker) I had the same question  and ended up buying two of those.
2645,What is the width of the UV ultraviolet Non-waterproof 3528SMD 600 LEDs 500CM flexible LED Light Strip.  I'm looking for something that is 8mm,Just measured my UV strip. It is 7mm
2646,Does this include the white piano stand and music stand and the sustain pedal as well?,"Yamaha does include the matching legs as well as a small sustain pedal-picture a black spring loaded box.  If you want a piano style sustain pedal, go for the Yamaha FC4 or the LP7 pedal board.  Note that the FC4 is metal and the LP7 pedal board is plastic."
2647,Is this one better than the Numark Mixtrack Pro II?,"I purchased the Mixtrack quad a couple months back for an affordable controller to use at my local DJ shows. The biggest differences are the fact that this controller has 4 decks rather than 2, and this one has 16 different colors to customize it with. Basically, you pay a little extra for 2 more decks and more attractive colors. The colors are very well lit up and do make it look a lot more professional than the MTP2."
2648,Looking at the 712 and 612. I am a musician who also does production. Why would I want to spend the extra money for the 712s?  Thanks.,"I own the 712's and 702's, but not the 612's so I can't fully comment on your question. However, I can say that the 712's are much better than the 702's. The 712's have a richer bass tone, which more than makes up for the lack of bass in the 702's. With the 702's I was producing mixes that actually had too much bass to compensate. The 712's are extremely clear, clean sounding, yet extremely flat too (except maybe a tiny boost in the bass, but it is not a boomy sound - still very clean). You can listen to them for a long time without getting fatigue. Also, they are more comfortable than the 702's. Another headphone that I really love is the Audio Technica ATH-M50's. They are definitely more fun to listen to than the 712's, and way better than Dr. Dre Pro's, but the highs and lows seem to be a bit more exaggerated (which is why they sound so good). They are closed back too, which makes them not quite as good for mixing as the 712's. But, they are in the $100-$150 price range. I hope this helps...

2649,"I'm looking for speakers for my living room to attach a turntable to.  The room is 17'x14', would these be recommended for this?",You will also need a phono preamp to equalize the RIAA curve and boost the signal to the line level required by the built-in power amplifiers.
2650,Will these work with a 9V battery (using a 12V to 9V converter)?,"Why would you convert 12v to 9v?  The lights are produced to operate on 12v.  If you are asking if they will operate on a little 9v battery as from a smoke alarm, poorly.... blink a few times and lights out, can test a minute to see if they work ok? If using a brick battery with a few amps or so, they will work ok....or at least the strips have for me, but poorly compared to giving the full 12v+ they are made for. Best I can offer from the question is give the strips the 12v+, and at least 2a per strip needed to work as expected."
2651,Can you spec the exact cables I need to plug and play two of these into my computer? I am not too tech savvy.,"Of course, i have mine plugged directly to my computer so it's a 3.5 mm standard headphone jack, but the monitors need 1/4, RCA, or XLR. I chose the 1/4 to 3.5mm, i bought these ones and are great: Hosa CMP159 Stereo Breakout, 3.5 mm TRS to Dual 1/4 in TS, 10-Feet-Esteban"
2652,Can it accomodate a 49 key keyboard?,No
2653,Does this work with iPad Air 2? Has anyone actually used with the Air 2?,"Yes it works fine!, just use the iPad air adapters, the air 2 is easier to snap in and remove than the air (which was really tight), but is held securely. I use it every day."
2654,Can anyone tell me approx. what size of floor space this would take when sitting at it.   I  have a small room it would need to go in.,It's about the size of a XL recliner space.  Not very much space needed because it folds into smaller chair
2655,Is the LiveMIC compatible with a Bose Soundlink Mini speaker?,"Yes, the LiveMIC is working with Bose Soundlink Mini speaker since both are using pair code ""0000"". Please use Mode A on LiveMIC with Bose Soundlink mini speaker"
2656,Does this have a music-activated mode that changes colors and patterns based on the music beat of a live band?,"yes ,you are right"
2657,"Does the sound come from the attached device, such as the iPad?  Or do you have to attach or Bluetooth to speakers?","Sound comes out of the ""attached device"" such as your iPhone/iPad. But you can hook it up to an external speaker/stereo or bluetooth speaker."
2658,does this ship with the lightning cable?,"Yes.  In the product details, it says that the unit ships with the lightning and other cables necessary to hook up the unit to iPhone, iPad and Macbook."
2659,What is an easy way of pairing this device with my Ipad or Ipod?  Both my Ipad and Ipod do not seem to recognize this product?  Thanks.,This gave me some trouble as well...but here is how I got it to workTurn OFF Bluetooth on iPadAfter charging the headset.....press button on top and wait until it blinks red/blue.....don't stop pressing that button when you see it blinking blue....keep holding it until you see it blinking red/blueTurn on Bluetooth in iPadYou will see your new deviceClick to pairThen enjoy
2660,Hello sir are the Shipping Weight  is  4 pounds for this product,25 Pounds.
2661,Will this cable work specifically with an Ibanez IBZ10B Rehearsal Rig 10-Watt Electric Bass Guitar Combo Amp and a JAY TURSER MODEL JT-220/VS VINTAGE SUNBURST SETNECK LP GUITAR?,"I have never seen musical equipment (electric) that did not use a 1/4"" cable.  Some components made for home stereos or vocals use RCA jacks or 3 prong round jacks (I forget the name of the common mic jacks!), but 1/4"" is standard for guitar, bass, and universal equipment.  So they should work."
2662,i would like to use this with my Canon DSLR Camera for shooting videos and would like to know if you think that this will work well.,"I use it for external audio with my canon dslr's. The preamp in those cameras is pretty lousy, so expect mediocre sound quality. I use an external audio recorder for it and sync the audio in post. I use the H1 Zoom and get excellent audio quality. Definitely the recommended method of recording audio with those cameras. I love this audio technica set as well. Sounds really great."
2663,Will this work with a Technics SL1200 turntable?,Yes this will work with a Technics SL1200 turntable so long as you have a standard headshell to mount it on.
2664,does this have volume control,"No they do not have a volume control.  They are a nice sounding headphone, especially for the price!  :-)"
2665,I just bought an AT-LP60 tunrtable and I'm new to vinyl but I have heard the stylus has a ton to do with the sound quality. Will this fit my table?,"No, because of the type of tone arm mount that your turntable has."
2666,Sold in pairs or single?,Single
2667,What string gauge come with this?,It may vary based on where you get it from but mine had 10g string
2668,Will this fit a 2 and 1/4 inch classical guitar neck?,"I believe so, I've used it on Fenders, Guilds, and Martins of various neck widths/thicknesses; it's been pretty resilient"
2669,is this guitar lightweight?,"Yes very light, great intonation, action is perfect stays in tune and I love playing it. This is my opinion and I have been at this making music for over 20 years professionally! SUPER LIGHT"
2670,Is this flight safe?,I don't think it's really meant for flights. You will probably want something with metal edges and verticies; an ATA case.This case is great for gigs and packing your van up tight and neat.
2671,My favorite guitar is stored out in the open on a stand.  My other guitars are in cases.  Is this the right humidifier for me?,"This humidifier works fine in a case to get humidity in the guitar quickly; although I use this one at times in one of my older guitars, I tend to use HumidiPak (also sold by Amazon.com) to keep the case at about 47 percent humidity at all times. If a guitar sits open, the room needs to be in the right humidity range -- this particular product would likely dry quickly in an open room (unless you are in a very humid area."
2672,we need a practice amp for both guitar and bass. its for a small space. can this one handle bass w\o dying? how about elec drums?,"I'm going to say ""Yes, it can"".  The Pignose HOG 30 is a great little amp.  But it has some limitations that you need to be aware of, so you can work around them.I got it primarily because it is battery powered.  I play stand-up bass often out on the street jamming with fellow bluegrass pickers.  But even if AC power is available, it is great to be able to set up without concern for finding an outlet and lugging an extension cord.  Also, battery power is pure ""DC"", absolutely clean, no hum, buzz, ground loops, or potential for electrocution.  (Note: While you can run it with the charger plugged in, both Pignose and I would recommend that you try to avoid doing that.)It is just so nice to have it all in one, simple to carry, package.  Set it down, plug in, and play.  The batteries add some weight (in fact, practically ALL the weight), but it is not bad, and that does keep it in place.  And they last a LONG time on a full charge.  I've not yet run out of juice, and I've easily played 20 hours between charges.  But then, I don't crank it up very loud (perhaps 25% at most), which reduces battery drain.Now, to your specific questions.  This is not a bass amp, but I do use it with my stand-up ""doghouse"".  However, to get the sound I want, I do have the bass setting all the way up, the treble all the way down, and the mid range at about 9:00 or 10:00 (approx 25% up).  So if you plan to run both guitar and bass thru it, you may not be pleased with the ""EQ"" balance.It does come with 2 inputs.  Both 1/4"" jacks.  One on the front, the other in the back.  I'm almost certain they are simply wired together in parallel.  I've not taken it apart to confirm that, but I did plug a microphone into one.  When I switched the mic ""off"" (which shorts the circuit), the signal from the other jack also muted.  So the 2 jacks are likely just a ""Y"" connector.  That can cause some problems.I like having the 2 inputs for practice sessions.  I plug my bass into one, and an MP3 player into the other.  That makes it easy to listen to a tune we're trying to learn.  But, the bass pickup is Hi-Z, and the MP3 is low-Z which kills the signal from the bass.  My ""fix"" was to build an impedance-matching attenuating cable to use with the MP3 in order to level the playing field.  That works fine.But I still have the ""EQ"" issue.  When playing I want the bass setting all the way up, and the treble all the way down.  When listening I want it all ""flat"" at 12:00.  I use a pre-amp with my bass that has EQ, so now I use it to boost the bass, and run the amp flat.  You will likely have the same issue trying to play bass and guitar through it at the same time.I don't see any problems using electric drums, other than the ""EQ"" imbalance and impedance mismatching you may have if you try to run it all together.  Your fix may be to feed the amp from a small mixer that you use to balance EQ and levels.  But that means you have another piece of gear to haul and hook up.  If you go that route, let me recommend some of the small Behringer XENYX line of mixers.  I have some of those, and love 'em!  They sound great, offer magnificent control, are rugged, inexpensive, and most can run on battery power.So back to your needs.  I would recommend the HOG 30 mostly for its portability.  It is one of the few battery-powered amps that can offer great sound for small venues without worry that it will be drained before the gig is over.  You could do 3 or 4 gigs on a charge (but don't push it, fill up the charge for each show ... that's honestly why I don't really know how long a charge will last).But if portability is not your main focus, there may be better options available.

2673,What is the minimum height this bar can be lowered to?  I'm looking to use this as a blanket stand for newborn photography.,"I believe they are 55"" tall un-extended. I use them at 10' tall, but pack them in a 5.5' case with a few  inches of space. They are the same size as the OnStage lighting stands you can find specs on other seller sites."
2674,would this be suitable for holding a banjo?,"Yes, if the banjo has a resonator back. If it is an open back banjo, then no."
2675,what is the difference between slinky and non slinky?,"Short answer: marketing. For the real story see the Ernie Ball website, but if you trust my memory... many, many moons ago there were few guitar string makers and they pretty much made the same thing- strings that helped a guitar be heard in a Big Band environment. The Ernie Ball company was one of the first to start marketing ""boutique strings"" that were easier for the player to fret and to bend. Compared to other strings at the time (anybody remember Black Diamonds?) the word ""slinky"" pretty much described how they felt."
2676,How is the sound of this? how does it play?,It plays very well in tune and has a nice sweet tone. Easier to finger too than other clarinets I've had in the past. The Buffet mouthpiece that came with it is also very nice and I use it instead of more other expensive mouthpieces. I highly recommend the Buffet B12.
2677,Do they come with any type of case?,"They come in a very sturdy cardboard box.  However, I purchased the 8 note black fabric cases with zipper closure.  I prefer the 8 note cases to the 13 note cases.  I just ordered four 8 note cases to cover my 20 note set of Bells.  To play different key signatures a total of 20 bells purchased as a 20 note, or individual sets, is more beneficial than just 8 notes. A3 thru E5.  Recommend; Handbell accompaniment Books:   ""Sweet Pipes Books with CD"""
2678,Do you need a mixamp/preamp/mixer/audio interface to use this microphone on a PC or is it optional?,"Yes, a preamplifier is required in order to use this microphone. It requires an XLR port which is not on any motherboard."
2679,Will it work well with a bass guitar?,"Personally I do not like the Dyna with a bass. The Dyna is geared towards thinner strings at a higher octave than a bass. What will happen when you run this particular compressor with a bass is that you will over compress and your notes will become very ""muddled""; loosing tone and a rich bottom end. MXR has a series for bass. I would look at that rather than the Dyna. Bass compressors tend to compress less thus allowing your natural tone to come through and leveling out the volume of string slaps and such."
2680,will this fit on a  tama  hi hat  stand,YES! My primary HH is a Tama heavy duty.
2681,Will Taylor Big Baby fit in it?,"No, Taylor's Big Baby is clearly too big for this little case, based on the spec's on Taylor's web site."
2682,"If you use the uke without electricity, does it sound like an acoustic uke?  Is it loud enough to hear like an acoustic uke?",My daughter plays hers both ways no difference with quality of sound
2683,"will the grovers fit a 1972 martin d-35.  the holes were drilled bigger to take ping tuners BIG MISTAKE What do you suggest.? trying to keep it as close to vintage as possible.hank you, paul","d28 and  35 are the same in my opinion in head stock   and I'm  sure didn;t change hole size, but since it has been drilled a bit ,    I  have in past carefully lined the the hole with a very thin paper ,wood, etc .  to just take up a bit of the slack to snug up the fit. Don't be afraid to try this for it can work and is rewarding. I honestly feel there is no lost of sound with this for you still have your bushings??  I lve the grovers and still have them in my 72 d28. It's like re-sleavieng an old  piston wall Chevy Block, but easier. Best"
2684,Is this for the 5/8 inch thread?,Yes
2685,I don´t see any information if the cable is included with this mic,"As with any microphone of quality, cords, and stands are not included.  I use mine with a boom stand and the head tilts back perfectly.  The best mic for live vocals I have ever used!"
2686,What is the main difference between custom light and light gauge strings please?,"Custom lights are in between light and extra light..... For me, they're just right... Extra lights sacrifice too much tone, but I need something pretty light for finger-picking...."
2687,will this microhone work with any wireless transmitter that has the same connector,You will need the same connector on the wireless trasmitted but the wireless receiver will need the same frequencies as the portable transmitter.
2688,Some owners say the speaker in this amp is weak and they recommend replacing but most reviews I read though like it stock - what's the verdict?,The amp suits our needs very well just tbe way it is.
2689,what is the difference between slinky and non slinky?,"Short answer: marketing. For the real story see the Ernie Ball website, but if you trust my memory... many, many moons ago there were few guitar string makers and they pretty much made the same thing- strings that helped a guitar be heard in a Big Band environment. The Ernie Ball company was one of the first to start marketing ""boutique strings"" that were easier for the player to fret and to bend. Compared to other strings at the time (anybody remember Black Diamonds?) the word ""slinky"" pretty much described how they felt."
2690,What all comes with this?,I received a recorder and a plastic cover with snap.  The recorder is sturdy and held up well.
2691,Is there a timer I could buy to go along with this fog machine?,Eliminator sells remotes with timer for their machine.http://www.cheapdjlighting.com/Fog_Machine_Timer_Remote_p/ef-trm.htm
2692,"The handle and clasps are snug, right? Nothing feels loose or wobbly?",Mine was good and snug. I was very happy with it.
2693,is it one piece or two folded,This particular one is one telescoping pole and the rest folds up so it is actually 1 piece.
2694,I have a shure headset wireless transmitter model T 1G-CL is my question is is the shure wb98h/c intrument mic is compatible or say is it gonna work ?,"YES 99.9% chance it will work, presuming your transmitter is mini XLR input. All Shure mini XLR wireless connectors (that I am aware of) are configured/wired the same."
2695,how does this lock fit on to your guitar?....How does it 'lock' onto your guitar?,"When you place it over your strap button after your strap, you twist the plastic piece to tighten or close the hole up over your button so it cannot slide off.  They actually work very well and I would highly recommend to anyone.  Especially to those who don't feel like altering their guitar and purchasing expensive strap lock style buttons.  I'll be using these for all of my guitars that I use a strap with.  I bought 3 sets and need to buy more."
2696,Will this work with the Pyle Pro PWMA230 Wireless PA System?,"This works on most PA systems.  However, I would not recommend this product to anyone because the sound quality is very poor in wireless mode, but okay when wired like a regular mic.  I have tested in on my 3 different PA systems: Bose L1, Fender Passport 300, Rockbox.  There is a lot of static.  Definitely not a well-made product, hence the cheap price.  I would qualify this as a toy, maybe for a kid's sing-along."
2697,How do I hook up the MXL 770 to my PC to get broadcast quality?,"You need something that supplies the mic with Phantom Power and connects to your PC via USB. I would use something like a ""MXL MICMATE PRO XLR To USB Preamp with gain"". Then, you need a PC with a sound card that can handle the quality you require and an internet connection that can broadcast (upload) the amount of kbps you are wanting to send. Good Luck and happy recording!"
2698,are they make in china?,"Yes shure it is , bought a brand new j6 system and opened it up "" MADE IN CHINA"""
2699,How long is the cord?,6 ft I think
2700,Is the bass LIGHT Natural finish (NOT mahogany).  I will only buy this if it has a natural LIGHT finish (ash; birch; maple).,"Ours was not. It came looking more mahogany. Not what we expected, but still really good looking."
2701,how is this plastic set compared to metal harmonica,"It is different.  Because it is plastic it has a ""plastic"" taste to it, and for me one of the wholes doesn't play to full strength.  For the money(if you were considering buying the set) it's worth it.  But the metal one is overall better."
2702,I have a turntable with the Audio Techics AT3600L Cartridge.  My amplifier is 200watts with 300 mv sensitivity.  Why is there very little volume?,"If you're sure you have the polarity right on the cartridge, that's about all there is to it.  Check the connections, make sure the terminals are all mating snugly etc. ...was this working at all before?  You got to have a phono input or preamp, turntables aren't strong enough by themselves, but you probably know this."
2703,"I have no experience with recording equipment--what do I need to (part and example, please) make this work with a laptop? Thanks!",If you are new to this try a USB version.  This mic will also require an amplifier and 48V power.  Great mci but not as a starter Audio-Technica ATR2500-USB Cardioid Condenser USB Microphone
2704,"This may be a silly question, but you can mount this directly using drywall anchors, right?","You can, but I would recommend finding the wood stud behind the drywall."
2705,Is this a glass washboard?,This one is the steel version. Better for regular clothes and even most delicates. Of course glass is for the finest of materials.
2706,Does this come with a power adapter?,No it does not but you can get a wall wart or power source for one just about any place. I went to Good Will store and found one for .99 cents and it works just fine. You just have to be careful not to get the polarity reversed as the negative is the inside pole and it should be 9 volt direct current with a correct size or snug fitting plug.If you don't want to go on a scavenger hunt I would recommend buying one through this site.
2707,Does this work with a 36 string autoharp?,All tuners I know of are monophonic...they will tune one note.  The korg units are not my favorites.  They are not really very durable or reliable.  The built in mc is pretty lame.  The tuners that use vibration seem to work better for most acoustic stringed instruments.
2708,how to set it up?,"Lest you think there are no screws included in the package, check the ends of each piece where you will find the screw already in place;  unscrew each screw with the Allen wrench provided.  You also need to visualize how the stand will lock into place before putting it together or you'll have to take it apart and rearrange the pieces in order to engage the locking piece.  It's fairly intuitive, shorter pieces on top, longer on bottom for stability.  I didn't find the screws and Amazon customer service quickly sent me a new stand from which I was to remove the screws from the box and then return it; meanwhile I read reviews here and found the screws weren't missing after all.  Too bad the location of the screws is not mentioned in the packaging.

2709,"Will this bag fit an Ibanez Acoustic/Electric Bass Guitar, want to buy it for my husband but don't want to ask him about it. Thanks!",this bag easily handles my ibanez 4 string bass and a friends 6-string brice electric bass. it should be able to handle a hollow body guitar or bass but i'm not sure about an acoustic bass. it might fit but... a hardsell case is just better for acoustic guitars and basses.  a bit more expensive but worth it.
2710,"will it fit an epiphone joe pass guitar 4"" deep?","Probably,  lots of extra room,  really a nice case.  becareful when putting down tuners r a little unprotected.  padding on side where tuners r is thin  . :-)"
2711,What's the difference between this and the C-3?,"The C-1 is a directional microphone, best used for vocals (singing, rapping) because it only picks up in one direction and ignores pretty much everything else. The C-3 is a Dual-Diaphragm Condenser mic, so it has 3 settings, it can pick up sound all around it, front back and then it has a similar setting to be used as a directional mic.Basically it gives you a few more options, but the C-1 is pretty good if you only want a directional mic."
2712,will this fit a pBone?,Yes
2713,Would this Op/Tech strap be good for a very heavy loaded computer bag?,Comfort-wise and ability to hold it yes. Assuming it is long enough to be comfortable for you there won't be any issues with this handling the weight!
2714,can someone tell me what can i do to solve the hissing noize ?,"Try using different speaker connections, I switched to use the TRS connectors and when I did I lost the buzz."
2715,is there a connection for coaxial cable on the back,"Yes, there are coax connections, this is from the manual:Surge Protected COAX/RF ConnectorsThe H10 provides surge protection for your CATV system,Cable Modem, DSS, or Antenna system. The surge protectionfeature prevents surges traveling over Coaxial data lines fromdamaging the system.Connect the coaxial cable from the CATV or Cable Modemprovider to the connector marked ""IN.""Connect other cable from the connector marked ""OUT"" to thedevice being protected (CATV box or Cable Modem)."
2716,Do you need to have a stand for this pad?,"You don't need a stand, but it's better if you have one.  You could rest the practice pad on your lap or on a chair.  Mounting it in a snare drum stand is the best way to use this practice pad, as it allows you to sit comfortably (properly), and adjust the height and angle of the practice pad...so I would highly recommend getting a snare drum stand with this practice pad."
2717,Is this for adults or children?,The guitar is adult sized. I bought it for my teen son who is basically adult sized. I'd say it would fit fine for an older child or teen. But my judgment is a bit skewed as my boys are very tall. It is just important a child can get his/her arm over the top and reach the strings
2718,Voltage 110 or 220,110
2719,Could this tune down to 432 instead of 440?,Hi Regina. Yes the tuner can be calibrated A4 from 349 to 499 Hz in 1Hz steps
2720,can this hard case accommodate Spector MK5 Pro bass guitar?,"The case does not have cutaways for a specific body shape. I can not say specifically if it fits your bass, but I have several different basses and they all fit."
2721,my desirable configuration is: ATPL120 turntable output to preamp and from preamp to Sony TMR-RF970R headphones. Can I have enogh strong signal?,"if it is an audio technica atpl120, then it already has a phono preamp, so if you hook it up to a stereo or headphones, you should be hearing it in full volume control. so I would think just hooking it up to your headphones will give you full volume.1980s or older turntables don't have a preamp so they relied on specially revamped phono audio hookups, but yours already is preamped so you don not need any addition preamp devices."
2722,What is the different on H7 K7 M7?,The different models are on different bands. They are basically the same microphone otherwise.
2723,Will this hold the Blue Yeti?,"It will only hold the blue yeti if you get the blue microphone radius shockmount. The standard yeti mic stand screws into the sides of the mic. The shock mount is made specifically for the yeti as the bottom mounting hold is only half an inch deep and nearly an inch wide and is not a standard size at all. However the radius shockmount has the standard mic boom sized holes at its base. The yeti is meant to hang upside down in the shockmount. From personal experience, the yeti is very heavy but this mic stand is incredible. However, it will only give a steady platform if the boom arm is online with the length of the base to act as a counter weight. Also if you do this, the radius shock mount has 2 plastic o-rings and a screw that allow you to angle the mic and shockmount up or down. The only way to keep it level is to replace those plastic o-rings with the rubber o-rings that are in the standard yeti mic stand where it screws into the sides of the mic.



    It will only hold the blue yeti if you get the blue microphone radius shockmount. The standard yeti mic stand screws into the sides of the mic. The shock mount is made specifically for the yeti as the bottom mounting hold is only half an inch deep and nearly an inch wide and is not a standard size at all. However the radius shockmount has the standard mic boom sized holes at its base. The yeti is meant to hang upside down in the shockmount.

2724,Can you  use the Equalizer that is on Mono mike inputs on sterio inputs 5/6 thu 11/12. (Xenyx 802 has Equalizer usage on sterio inputs 3/4 5/6),The Behringer 1202 mixer does not have equalizers on the stereo inputs.  It only has them on the mic inputs.  Most anything that you will use with this mixer on the stereo inputs will have its own equalizer.  The mic inputs have a three band equalizer.
2725,have included kick pedal,No. All you get is the batter head
2726,Can anyone who has this product tell me where the items are made? Amazon info does not list a country of origin.,They are made in Isreal.
2727,does it come with the extender cord? compatible with M-Audio fast track - cord from the existing headphone jack to amp?,"To clarify further, it does NOT come with a cord as stated. What you would want to buy is a 1/4"" 'TRS' cord to connect from the Fast Track's headphone jack to the input of this headphone amp. These are available on Amazon as well. If you use a regular 1/4"" instrument cable, you lose stereo. TRS sends both right and left signals."
2728,Includes a motor that can be run with batteries or with a DC power supply (sold Seperately) is the discription. So does everything shown come with thi,"Hi there.  Everything is included. The motor runs on DC and can run on AC.  You need to buy your own AC adapter to do so.  I've been satisfied just with battery operation.  I upgraded to an LED spot because the included spot floods more than spots, but it does the job.  Remember the price:  you can spend a lot more, but this kit is pretty good."
2729,Is this going to work with a laptop that has Windows 8?  Thanks in advance for your attention to this question.,"I don't know, I use it with Windows 7. Check the maker's site."
2730,"Did you have to bring the instrument in for initial adjustments (set the bridge, etc) or did you just play it out of the box?",The Cremona SV-175 model is set-up in USA Cremona workshop for easy playability that works well for beginning students.
2731,What else have you used since this dosen't exist anymore?,"""Chord Pick Out"""
2732,"Hi, is this an electric guitar?","Yes. It has a piezoelectric pickup underneath the bridge (the dark wood piece near the bottom that the strings stretch over).  I use mine with both regular amplifiers (e.g. marshal, fender) and headphone amps (e.g. vox amplug) and it SOUNDS GREAT.  It sounds clean for country and acoustic songs, and it is powerful enough to drive amps for heavy metal sounds. The piezoelectric pickup is like many that are installed on fullsize acoustic guitars (that have a 1/4 jack for the guitar cable).  If you do not plug the Traveler Ultralight into an amplifier, you can barely hear the strings.  It sounds like ""tink tink tink"", it is like when an electric guitar is not plugged in, but the Ultralight's body is so dense that un-plugged it is much quieter than an un-plugged electric (e.g. tele, strat, or les paul). Traveler sells a ""sister"" model (Ultralight Electric) that looks almost identical, except it includes a ""blade"" electric guitar pickup between the bridge and the tuning keys.  They also have another model (""Pro-Series"") that includes both the piezo and blade pickups, but it has a removable wooden arm that includes knobs so you can adjust how much of each different pickup is heard.  Go to their website, http://www.travelerguitar.com/  In the USA you can buy them at GuitarCenter stores.  You can also buy them via Amazon. The basic Ultralight is $280-300, the ""Electric"" is appx $380, the ""Pro"" is $400.I LOVE mine. I can practice almost anywhere (even Not plugged in), I travel with it alot, I watch TV with my wife as I practice, I watch my son at his kung-foo class as I practice, I take it to bars and sit in the corner and practice to myself, I join jams with a minutes notice, I use at lunch at work...  its great!

2733,Will this allow me to plug in a aquistic guitar and mic?,"Most definitely. The K3000FX will deliver a clear, clean sound that's ideal for gigging plus the K3000FX has internal effects."
2734,What is the length and the height of this saddle ?Thanks !,You can check this pagehttp://www.graphtech.com/products/brands/tusq/tusq-acoustic-saddlesThere you will find all saddle options each one with the corresponding specs.
2735,"I just got this fog machine but there were no instructions.  Is there a website I can go to for answers?  Type of juice,  cleaning etc.","I'm a good sheep, so I always use fog juice that says it's for ground foggers. Don't know if it really makes that much of a difference. I do use dry ice in the machine as it makes the fog colder so it stays lower longer. As far as cleaning it, you can just do an internet search for how to clean a fog machine. I'll be honest with you - I've never cleaned mine. At the end of Halloween, I just put it away with whatever juice is left in it, and when I take it out the next year and add some juice, it works just fine. If/when it becomes an issue, I will be doing that internet search myself."
2736,Could this be used with a clip on acoustic pickup (eg HDE)  and with a small portable speaker?,No. There is not enough power output to drive a speaker. You might get some sound but it would sound terrible.  You need an amplifier.
2737,Do these effect the quality of the sound in any way?,"It does affect the snare and symbols most.  I bought them to be able to practice without disturbing neighbors.  You can strike as hard as you normally play and experience an 80% reduction in volume.  That said, you would never perform using the pads due to sound quality."
2738,Is the kick drum pad wide enough to use a double-kick pedal?,Yes it is. Your left pedal is going to need something to stick to like carpet.
2739,does it come with a strap?,No it doesn't come with a strap but the guitar is awesome for the price.
2740,Can we connect a different guitar strap to the guitar? are there 'buttons' to connect to?,Yes you can
2741,It doesn't show the back side. Does the shoulder straps mean it can be carried like a backpack?,"Absolutely!  Either on one shoulder like if you're just going out to the car, or on both like a backpack.  There's a photo of the back here: http://static.music123.com/derivates/18/001/306/318/DV016_Jpg_Large_541318.001_black_back.jpg"
2742,"Does the wire have memory, ie, is it hard to straighten?",It is easily straightened by clamping one end in a vise and twisting 3-4 twists per inch with pliers or vise-grips while pulling it straight.
2743,Can this unit be used for harmonica playing also,I would look somewhere else if you want the classic tube sound. This unit sounds better with guitar and has a mild effect really.
2744,What is the different on H7 K7 M7?,The different models are on different bands. They are basically the same microphone otherwise.
2745,"will it fit a 5""5'/110 lb (girl)  player? i am concerned it might be too long and not possible to adjust. thanks :)","Yes, it will certainly adjust to that size, with no problem. Most comfortable strap out there."
2746,where is it made ?,"I own this exact guitar. It says on the back of the headstock, below the serial number, ""Made in China"". But, don't let that necessarily be a deciding factor. This is a decent starter guitar. I've gotten a lot of use and pleasure out of it - and, even though I've since bought a different (more expensive) guitar, this still tends to be my ""go to"" if I'm just wanting to jam."
2747,"So, is it just background music or are there vocals?  Thanks",There are background vocals.
2748,Opinion on how this would work in a beach club setting playing from my laptop.Microphone sound quality?,You would be surprised at sound quality of this mixer. I own two and love them. I play in large and small venues and it does a super job in all places! I play Beach and other kinds of music and Karaoke from a laptop and it works well for all! Microphone quality is excellent...
2749,Is this wireless? or do you use standard xlr cable,Xlr cable
2750,does this amp have RCA inputs i can run my ipad into and will it work well with a pair of 700 Watt PA speakers?,yes it does but i do not reccomend buying pyle pro amps i went thru 3 of these amps that i orderd cause 2 of them blew a channel 5 minutes after hooking it up and turning it on you get what you pay for when it comes to amps and these are junk
2751,"If the batteries run out while recording with the LS-10, will you lose the recording?","No, everything is saved to memory drive"
2752,What are the dimensions of the individual cases?,"Designed to fit 22"" x 18"" bass; 12"" x 10"" and 13"" x 11"" toms; 16"" x 16"" floor tom; and 5-1/2"" x 14"" snare."
2753,Can this be daisy chained with my hard drive?,How do you mean?
2754,"Just bought this used to use with my new Mac for recording, but it didn't come with software.  I'm new to recording.  Help me find the software link?","Go to <Apple menu> / System Preferences / Sound, and choose ""AudioBox USB"" for the Input and Output. That will set the default input/output for recording/playback software (e.g. Garageband, Audacity) to be the AudioBox USB. Note that many audio apps allow you to override the default audio input/output with preferences within the app itself."
2755,can i put this mic in a normal mic stand? or will it only work on the table stand it comes with.,Yes you can. I have my personal one mounted on a boom stand. Which works for me
2756,Can you use serato scratch live with this mixer?,"Yes you can but you will still need sarato audio interface, no getting around that., but on the cool side you will be able to used the Behringermixer as a midi controller for sarato efx. . Hope this helps"
2757,IS this suppose to be the XLR or USB version?,"This is the XLR version (as Matthew pointed out, the USB version says it in the title).  I haven't had any problems of hissing or background noise with this mic, the internal noise of the mic is actually superb.  In Matthew's case, maybe it could be a defective mic (that should be exchanged under warranty), or a poor quality or damaged pre-amp, which is often the case."
2758,Good for classical and vocals?,"Yes these headphones are exceptionally and accurate ..... I play a keyboard capable of over 12,000 sounds, I have not found one not reproduced accurate through these headphones ...."
2759,Does the seat spin or is it locked?,You can keep it locked or make it spin
2760,Does it come with a tuner.,Yes it did. But I didn't like that tuner so I use an iPhone app instead.
2761,Do these come in pair? or do i have to buy one for each side of the guitar?,One pkg has 2 so it will do one guitar and strap.
2762,what are the hole sizes on the head of the guitar?,"They are whatever the standard size is for machine heads, which I think is 10mm.  I threw away the heads that came with it and ordered quality locking heads from Axes R Us, and they fitted perfectly without incident."
2763,I notice 2 inputs on the rear. Do I need to use them both for proper operation?,No.
2764,Could I gig with just one of these cabs alone?,"Absolutely.  As long as this meets your power requirements you could do either small gigs without a PA, or large gigs where you just need stage volume.  You may need to pair this with another cabinet for larger gigs if you do not have a PA for sound reinforcement."
2765,"My daughter has a 1/2 violin - will this case work for it? If not, do you have a case that comes in purple that will fit a 1/2 size violin?",You have to buy the exact size case for your violin. A case made for a 4/4 violin would be way too big for a 1/2 size violin. And allow the smaller violin to move around inside of the case and possibly get damaged. Buy a 1/2 size case for your 1/2 violin and your violin will fit snuggly and securely.
2766,"does it come with the clear strips, or do i buy those separately?","It comes with black strips, but yes, it comes with everything you will need. You can buy them separately though. Hope this helps. Cheers!"
2767,How well does it clean carpet?,This machine cleans great!
2768,is it left handed?,"It is a right hand uke, but you can restring it to make it left handed.  There is nothing else the differentiates right and left hand sides in this instrument."
2769,is the pocket big enough to hold a music book?,Yes. My son puts both his books in it and also leaves his pencils/etc. junk in it...Yeah...do not worry about it...works well for us.
2770,Can you transpose on this keyboard?,"I don't know if you can transpose on this keyboard, since I bought it for my now 9 years old daughter. It has many functions she still is not using. Sorry for not being of much help."
2771,does it make a good travel guitar for an adult,"It is a good travel guitar based on the price. Because it is so inexpensive, you may not be too concerned about it getting banged up or lost. Based on size, I would say that it is not as good as a smaller sized guitar for travel. Please note that I am a small person in stature, so that is why I would make this comment. If you are a bigger person and the size isn't an issue, then it's great for travel. FYI-This guitar also has a wonderful sound and stays tuned for a very long time. I highly recommend this guitar!"
2772,Can I attach my tablet t it,"yes, need correct adapter from 1/8th to 1/4, easy to find at any radio shack."
2773,exactly how big is it?,"Honestly I would say width wise a little longer then a Quarter, & it was flat I didn't like it :-0 . It's too small literally. I thought that it was too small and cheaply made . In the pic it's portrayed like it was bigger and a full size mini saxophone but it wasn't :-0"
2774,Is this OK for a P-35? I'm planning to take it to South America by plane. Does it come disarmed? how big is the box?,"I have installed this with my Yamaha P-35, and it works fine.  There is a bit of 'free play' before the screws are tighten, about 1/8 to 1/4 in. total of space that you can move the keyboard left-right in between the 2 metal brackets at the 2 ends, but this doesn't cause any trouble.  Not sure if this is because the P95 is about 1/8+ in. longer than the P35, or maybe it's just extra space for calibration by design.  These end brackets attach the piano to the stand; their screws holes are big enogh to allow for this adjustment, and once the screws are tighten, the piano is secured without any issue.  These brackets are under the piano's frame, so the extra gaps are not noticeably visible, and the side pieces of the stand still fit the side ends of the P35 perfectly.

2777,Does this mic come with the mounting flange provided already in the box ?,Yes it does and it also has a lock so it cannot be removed if you need it.  It installed in minutes...easy!!!

2781,does it have a very wide neck?,"In my opinion, yes it does. It's about 1 cm wider than my Yamaha acoustic, but this is all I have to base it on/compare it to.The Hohner rangers from 6.5 cm at its widest to 5.5 at its narrowest.MK"
2782,will these work for audio technica ath-m59?,"I'm not familiar with the ATH-M59, but the ATH-M50 fit perfectly. Like the case was designed for them. The quality is very good. I've been traveling weekly with them and its held held very well. The zipper is smooth and has not broken iin weekly use. I highly recommend."
2783,Would this work with the Chauvet Geyser RGB?,"This remote uses a unique connector, the RGB appears to use a standard 3 prong plug. If that is the case then this remote will not be compatible."
2784,should i get this or the mv500?,I don't own the mv500 but IMO this violin has pretty decent sound quality for a violin of its low price. I was afraid of it sounding bad because I bought it from Amazon but it was perfect
2785,How much does the case cost?,Boulder Creek doesn't  make an acoustic bass case. I can get you a deluxe tweed/leather Michael Kelly Acoustic Bass Case for $159 or a generic case black case for $122 plus shipping.

2805,"How firm is the board portion of this bag?  I'm curious how much ""give"" there is in the bag/board itself when you go to press on the pedals.","It's basically a thick bag, I store my pedal board in it then take it out when I use it. The bag itself is very well made. easy to transport with strap."
2806,"Hi, will this fit Technics SL-BD20D?",Yes! It what I have on my Technics SL-BD20D sound good for the price.I thought of getting a Grado P-mount cartridge.
2807,"I picked one of these up in a guitar store once and strummed it a bit, it seemed smaller than a regular baby taylor. Is it smaller at all?",Yes
2808,trebal side is the right hand thread or?,Fit so the pull of the string tightens rather than undoes the thread in the peg hole.
2809,What are the dimensions of this product?,"Hello MrPat,The dimensions are: 6 1/2"" High, and 2"" in dia. This is an excellent microphone for voice-over.BP Smyth, Narrator"
2810,Does this guitar has steel strings?,:) Yep
2811,Can you add your own music to a song chip somehow?  Where do you see the words?,There appears to be no way to add songs to the chips. The words appear on your tv screen with stock images or your own images you must upload using your PC.
2812,Does the BA330 have any kind of weather sealing? Does anyone have any experience with this unit in the rain?,Rain and electronics do not mix. This unit is not sealed at every spot. Not even close. The knobs and connections will be exposed to the elements.
2813,Does this have a direct line out for recording?,No.
2814,"Hi, will it work with 220 and 110 volts?",The model I have uses standard U.S. 110 volts. There is not an option provided to support 220 for commercial or international use. You will need a converter.
2815,"Does the wire have memory, ie, is it hard to straighten?",It is easily straightened by clamping one end in a vise and twisting 3-4 twists per inch with pliers or vise-grips while pulling it straight.
2816,does this amp com with a footswitch,"Hello, Yes a 4-Button Footswitch is included from 8thstreet Music, Thanks!"
2817,Is this just the case or the complete system ( case with controller system),It's just the case
2818,Can this be powered with plug in power supply and will it stay on until turned off?,It can not be powered with a power supply and it will stay on until turned off or battery dies. Great tuner.
2819,is this cd the instrumental version?,"It's the music + singing - all the music with the lyrics being sung, plus the book to the production"
2820,Is this good with the ADJ mini fog?? or would it be harmful to it?,Do not use in the mini fog.  The machines are very different and you will destroy it.
2821,Looking at getting this for my Son who fly fishes and has a pontoon.  Will this work for hauling the pontoon to the water over rugged terrian?,"Probably not. I think it would be much too small, and the wheels are not really made for off-road use. Hope that helps."
2822,How long is the gooseneck ?,"I measured the gooseneck to be 11"". The length worked well for me, even with music taller than the stand. The clamp would slip, so my husband put a piece of foam rubber from the mail packaging under the clamp, then it never slipped."
2823,Does this come with the 1/4 inch cables?,This product does come with all the necessary cables to power the board and your pedals. It does not come with the cables necessary to link/chain the pedals. I hope this answers your question.
2824,Will this work as a carry-on for flights or does it need to be checked in? Thanks!,"That depends on the airline. I did a gig in Vegas last year and they let me put it in the coat closet, when I played in Austin at SXSW, they made me check it. But I checked it at the gate with all the baby strollers. So it doesn't have to go through the airport luggage system. It's a great case and the reason I got it was because I knew that if I had to check the guitar, it would be safe."
2825,Just got the unit set up and the speaker is buzzing.  Any ideas?,"Please contact our Tech Support at 866-524-8676, x309."
2826,"Does this mic require any kind of additional power (phantom or such), or can i plug it straight into my amp?","No additional power is needed. Just plug it in any 3.5mm transmitter and it won't let you down. It's clear, comfortable. I know it comes with an additional plug but I didn't need it."
2827,Does this tilt in all directions? (Or just forward and back?) I want something I can adjust to any angle.,"The top only tilts forward to back (it's designed for heavy loads - a ball joint would not be sufficiently strong or stable).  HOWEVER, the clamp on the mast for elevating the platform to specific heights allows the mast to rotate, so you can set where you want the tilt axis to face.  It is not as simple as a one-joint solution, but the platform can face in any direction without having to move the legs.  If you're going to rotate the platform in real time there is a locking pin which keeps the mast from dropping.  The bigger issue is the platform has no lip, so I suggest you add one (easy to do) to prevent devices from sliding off.

2828,"How ""noisy"" or ""clean"" is this product and how does it compare to higher end cables?",I have been using two of these for about 3 years and they have no noise in them.  I believe that you can purchase cables that may take more abuse and last longer.  I set sound and use these about 40 times a year.  They still work well.
2829,Could you please send to Brazil? How much cost to send? Thank you,"Hello, We only ship within the U.S. Thank you."
2830,Will this work with Windows 8?,Yes and it also works with Mac.  I have each.
2831,"What color is this bag? Amazon pic for seller music123 is black, but on sellers website its gray ( including other companies)",it is black
2832,Would a Behringer BX4500H 450-Watt Bass Amp Head work with these? Or would the Behringer Classic 550-Watt BVT5500H be better? Overkill or underkill?,I have a BVT4500H on mine and they handle it just fine.I would say the 550 watt would not be a problem at all.

2835,Does this guitar come with an input to connect the amp cord?,"Yes it has electronic pickup, a 1/4 inch jack for an amp cable & volume & tone controls.  Plays well acoustically & amplified."
2836,"Are these schaller locking tuners a direct, drop in replacement for a mid 2000's PRS SE Soapbar II guitar (Korean made 2 P90's, double cutaway) ?",I haven't tried them on that guitar but they were a direct drop in replacement on my 2014 SE Custom 24.  I think the headstock is the same on these SE's so my guess is they should work fine.
2837,Is it compatible with Windows 8.1?,I use on a Dell laptop running 8.1 . It works great.

The lows from the bass can actually damage the speaker since it isn't a bass speaker.  The Fender Bronco 40 Bass amp costs more because of the bass capable speaker and additional power.  The Mustang series is for guitars, not basses and I would highly discourage you from using one for bass.  Even a cheap bass amp like the Fender Rumble 15 or the Behringer BX108 actually cost less than the Mustang amp and will make a better bass amp.  Between the two I'd go for the Rumble.

2839,"How is the audio quality, compared with Focusrite gear in the same price range (e.g., Scarlett 2i2)?","I would rather have a 2i2 based on the audio quality but the Akai EIE has additional features to justify its price. That being said I would rather have any Scarlett over the EIE.Focusrite's claim to fame is the quality of their converters. All of the Scarletts have the same converters, but the rest of the audio path gets better as you look at more expensive models.  If you want really good audio quality for the money buy the 2i2. If you want better audio quality buy a more expensive model such as the Scarlett 18i20."
2840,"Can you change pitch, or only speed?",My husband says it does both.
2841,Does it work with 32 bit computer?,"Yes, if your have midi software that is 32 bit, no problem.  Plug into the USB port and you are off to the races!  If you are new to midi recording also, make sure to download the free ""Ignite"" software that came with the keyboard.  It has basic user tutorials and walkthrus and basic synths and beats and so on that will ""Ignite"" your passion for musicmaking!"
2842,"do you need anything other than what it comes with to make it work, or does the unit come completely ready to use","Can't remember if it included batteries, but you don't want to use those anyway.  Have your own 9-volt.  Other than this, all you need is some kind of soundboard/speaker system to plug it into -- uses the larger, 1/4"" jack, comes with the cord."
2843,How does the Yeti attach to the mic stand?  The microphone has a base to sit on a flat surface.,There's a hole on the bottom of the mic that the stand screws into.
2844,"I bought the Shure 78S, Audio Technica Direct turn table, Audio Technica universal head shell. Screws are too short how to solve that please","Cartridge makers had way too much freedom in designing their cartridge bodies. Some mount with short screws, some with medium-size screws and some with long screws. The easy oversimplified solution to your problem is to find screws which are long enough. First find out how long a screw you need. Measure the height of the area of the cartridge through which the mounting screw will pass. Then add a little extra length for the area of the headshell the screw must pass through plus length for a washer and nut. Once you know the length you need you can either take your screw to a local hardware store and shop for or ask for the size screw (could be either english standard or metric) you are searching for. Or if you know the size of your screw in either english standard or metric terms you can try a web search for your specific size or try for the assortments of screws which some vendors offer. If you can't find an exact length, opt for a longer screw in the width you need because you can shorten the longer screw. If you need to shorten one remember to install a nut on it first and run it all the way up against the head before either cutting to length with a hack saw or grinding it to length. Removing the pre-installed nut after shortening will most always clean up the screw threads at the shortened end of the screw and make the re-installation of the nut when you mount the cartridge on the headshell easier. It sounds like a hassle, I know, but most of us cartridge swappers go through this at one time or another.

2845,is this guitar for 9-11years old kids,"I bought one for my 10 yr old grandson to play.  It's a bit heavy; so, he plays sitting down.  Being an electric guitar has two benefits for a young person.  The neck is narrower than an acoustic guitar which is easier for them to play chords.  Also,  it takes less pressure on an electric to press the strings down. Anyway,  my grandson likes it."

2848,using virtual dj want to know if this could be connected to computer,"Yes it can, it comes with a USB cord."
2849,Which hard cases would fit this guitar?,"I couldn't find just fit one.I usually use ordinary hard case when I do plane trip.First, remove the bottom bolt of the guitar, then put it into the case and stuff something into the space. I usually notes, books and towel to fill the space."
2850,How tall is the bass drum riser in inches? What's the clear distance of the batter hoop down to the floor?,Just a few inches. It lines up so mallet hits in the center.
2851,right or left hand?,Right
2852,"Hello guys, please, could someone tell me if this EQ would work with a normal home audio system?. Thanks!",Absolutely pull down the manual on line for more information.

2855,does this attach to speakers?,"No. This attaches to a PC running using USB (thru MIDI protocol). The software on your laptop, then uses the laptop audio to mix music, change the speed, select tracks. Instead of using the computer keyboard and mouse to control the software, you can use this controller. The computer emulates the functions of mixers, speed control, turntables, etc. to let you DJ with this, a laptop and amplifier. Nothing else needed except maybe a Mic mixer.."
2856,"Looking for a good digital recorder, we are going to holy lands and i would like to recorded the guided tours, and outside lectures","I use it to record music classes.  It is outstanding.  Parameters need to be turned on so sound isn't too faint nor too saturated. Outside lectures can be difficult for any device but this will do it about as well as anything.  Upon getting this I would suggest recording a TV show in your home, radio blasting from your stereo and talking.  Learn how to optimize the recorder for various environments and it will pay off on your trip with flawless recordings.  If that sounds too complex then get TASCAM DR-40 which can be set to record everything twice.  One is called a ""safety track"" at a lower level so you're sure to have something.  Buy a bunch of SD cards and an external hard drive to back up your work.

2858,Does it come with everything it shows in the picture for exactly 37.99 dollars plus shipping,No it sucks don't buy it because it only comes with the cup to put the sticks and the little top thing to hold papers. It's not even a stand it's legit just the top part of the stand. So I really don't think it's worth it.
2859,"does a soda can fit into this? Pepsi, Coke styles...thanks",They definitely fit though the can would be about 3/4 deep into it.  Not sure if that's a problem.
2860,Can this guitar be played unamplified?,"It is about the same as playing an electric guitar un-amped, you can hear it if you in a quite room.  I bought mine to play at work without annoying anyone while I practice.  I now use a VoX adapter and head phones because it is too quite and I found myself digging in too much in order to hear it un-amped."
2861,Will it be easy for an 8 year old to use?,"It is OK for 8 years old to use, but the songs for learning is very limited.  It is more like a toy instead of learning tools."
2862,Does this unit have a headphone output?,"Yes, use the L/Mono/phone jack in place of your amplifier for full stereo headphone sound capability.  Or if your amp has a headphone jack on the front or rear panel simply use that one for your headphones which is what I do.  Most newer model amps are made with headphone output jacks but if you happen to have say an older tube type Fender amp which sounds great, they won't have one so your only choice is to unplug the amp and attach your headphones in its place.  Hope this helps."
2863,what's the name of the application in the video?,"iPB-Nexus. It is the ""editor"" that allows you to communicate with the iPB-10. There are long standing issues regarding the stability of the Nexus software, Digitech support for the product, and it's ability to survive frequent apple updates. You should check user forums, such as thegearpage before you buy."

2867,Does it print out words to songs?,No it doesn't.

Thank you!,"The storage tray is 1.25"" below the edge, and there is a space from the edge to the bottom of cushion of about another 1.25"". That should give you a storage area just shy of 2 .5"" based on my quick and simple measurements. Had it for over a year and still in great condition after twice weekly use at a minimum."
2870,Is display window glass or plex?,Its glass
2871,"I want to connect this to an audio mixer, would I connect it by using the link output or mic input?",The output from your mixer should go to the mic or line input jack. The link output is to daisy chain to another monitor.
2872,Does this come with a set-up?,The set up from the factory was perfect for the OU5 that I got. Another Uke that I bought needed the fret ends polished . The neck on a ukulele isn't under the same stress as a guitar neck. Fewer strings with a lot less tension on a much shorter neck mean truss rod adjustments and bridge alterations aren't normally required. Most ukes don't even have truss rods so the saddle height is factory set for most players.
2873,Can this interface be used with line outputs from a digital piano?  It has midi ports but can the two  inputs be used to receive audio line signals?,I've plugged a Nord Stage2 into the 22vsl. Between the nord's output level and the 22's gain knob it was no problem to get a proper level.
2874,Can this be used for Rocksmith?    Acoustic guitar for rocksmith? And also please let me know if it is good/poorly?,"It can be used for an acoustic guitar, but it does not work well.  To pass the calibration, I felt that that the guitar had to be strummed very hard.  It had difficulty picking up the low E string unless I picked hard.  Initially, I thought it would work well enough, but after a few days I discovered it could not pick up bends or slides.  For what it's worth, a guitar shop employee told me that these sort of acoustic guitar pickups are noisy which makes the pickup detection more difficult."
2875,Would This Be Compatible With A  MXL 550/551?,"To add onto the other comment -- Yes, but this product is very cheaply made (picks up a lot of noise/static). Also, I had a bad experience with this particular seller. I suggest investing in a preamp (which provides power for your mic) to get the most out of your microphone. Especially a MXL. That's what I ended up doing and it was the best move."

2880,"Is the rod holding the plane included, if so how tall is it?","The Tab Station has a vertical piece 2"" long that screws into a microphone stand that is not included."
2881,just need to know the weight as want to take abroad thanks carol,It's 9.4 lbs with batteries installed.
2882,Do you know what is the range of the wireless? Thanks,I believe it's like 300 ft. but it wasn't that big of a concern for me because most stages are not longer than 60 ft. wide.
2883,I have bought this item before and only received the in ear monitor.  IS THIS THE RECEIVER AND MONITOR or am I buying the same thing again?,This is the receiver and the monitor.
2884,can you give us the complete model number,I have this unit. KS-886 is the complete model number.
2885,Will these stands hold Fender passport 150 speakers?,not familiar with the fender speakers - they will probably be ok - i would spend a few dollars more and get a higher quallity stand
2886,Does it work with android phones like the HTC One?,Yes it does. I purchased it for my HTC One and it works marvelously.
2887,"For singing videos, is it better to have the iCE or the regular Snowball?","KittyKatGirl,If you want the best quality for your singing (because I am sure you want no static or any other background noises like water dripping or heaters turning on) I would actually suggest the Blue Yetti. The Snowball has great quality HOWEVER it has a tendency to pick up background noise more easily since it has 2 microphones one in the front and one in the back. The Yetti is not too much more expensive, and it also has dials to change the way it acquires sounds. The Snowball has what I call a Wide Range. It picks up noises from the far right, left, up and down. The Yetti has the ability to be Wide Range or Short Range. If you were to pick either the iCE or the Regular I would pick the iCE.Brendan O'Shaughnessy

2888,can i change an existing wall switch to a dimmer switch to supply power to the low voltage led ribbon lights,"No-Your house current is 120 volts AC, I don't know just how low a dimmer lowers the voltage, but it is still AC current.The ribbon lights 12 volt DC current, you need the transformer to change voltage from AC to DC current. Then use a DC dimmer."
2889,Can u use serato with this controller,It's not designed for Serato and probably won't work as Serato as they specifically design their software to work with approved controllers.
2890,How comfortable is the seat? If I am going to spend hours on it I like it cushy.,It's really firm.
2891,Will this body pack work with the 788 series?,"I do not know, but in my research I found that the 788 series has body packs that look the same but the back-lighting on the display is blue where these are green. The same is with the handhelds. I do know that they operate in the same frequency range though."
2892,Does it comes with 2 speakers or the price is only for one?,Just one. Only one speaker.
2893,Where do I get a power cord and how come it doesnt come with it?,"It doesn't come with one because most people buying this pedal have other pedals and already have a power supply (or daisy chain power). I use a 1spot (I think visual sound makes them), and it works perfectly. Otherwise, you will need to use batteries."
2894,is it possible to have it with Euro plug type as well as 230V options?,"Thank you for contacting us. The Schiit Bifrost that we sell is designed for 115V outlets. Trying to run the 115V Bifrost through a 230V outlet could damage the unit and will void the warranty. For additional information on custom configurations and voltages, you may want to visit the manufacturer's website. Please let us know if you have any other questions!"
2895,what is the total height of the piano?,The keyboard's height is 28 in.
2896,Will this pickup fit an Ovation 1861 Balladeer?,"Gary, This will fit. I've installed this in an older Matrix and a Balladeer. If you do not have a preamp already in place, I'd recommend getting one. Your only issue if you have an older Balladeer will be the connection to the preamp. In the old models it was hard wired in and in the newer OP preamps you have that blade connector that the preamp connects to molded into the side."
2897,What size is the iPad dock? or what iPad fits in?,i have a ipad 2 fitting in it..it comes with two small plastic holders that let you slide them in the slot to fit your device- its pretty wide so i imagine a larger one would fit in it. the angle is ok but it does wobble a bit in the slot.
2898,Is this 16 bit or 24 bit?,This version of the StudioConnect is 16 bit.
2899,does it have Phantom technology?,"If you mean phantom power to operate condenser mic- yes, if you mean another phantom technology-no, they haven't mastered particle entanglement yet"
2900,Does it come with the cables? If not will I just need some basic RCA cables?,The A6 kit comes with 2 pairs of RCA-to-RCA cables.. Any pair of RCA will suffice though.
2901,"String spacing at the nut and saddle, and neck width","According to the Cordoba website, nut width is 48mm, string spacing at saddle 55mm, and neck width is not listed. I own an older model of this guitar (2007?) and the neck is probably large U shaped in comparison to other smaller size guitars that I tried out like the baby Taylor; but far more comfortable to me, which is one of the reasons I purchased this guitar."
2902,"How do you set this keyboard with OSX 10.9? MIDI setup shows no KORG and no app works with it, beside the apps included with the purchase.","I have no success setting up this device in osx. There are no specific drivers and, although the system has some vague idea thet the device is there, it will not let you set it up."

2905,yeti,"no, yeti is too big.  Its what I bought it for but it didnt fit.  So is sitting in box unuseable.  I had to buy a yeti specific mount and a stand with a standard mic threaded arm to use."
2906,what kind of stand would i need for this?,"this item is extremely heavy. And the connection part between mic and this item is too weak. so i bought one more mic stand for my microphone just to protect it. My  microphone which I care  a lot. i did not wanna take a risk. i use two separate stands for each. and still dont feel comfortable. buy a stand which is very strong and heavy. i bought this one which is better than regular ones. Pyle-Pro PMKS5 Compact Base Black Microphone Stand it is okay. but i wouldnt use the same stand for both. because i tried and result was really scary..

2907,Is this a full size viola?,Yes it is.  Purchased one for my daughter and have had no issues.  Great Buy!
2908,Will this work with a Windows surface tablet?,If the size is the same as an iPad should work without a problem the adjustment have tight fit so tablet is secured I love my
2909,Do You Need a Cab For The amp To Play? Ive Never Used and Orange :/,yes any speaker cab will work fine they even make a 8 inch cab just for this amp but I like it better with a larger cab.

2911,Are they potted?,Yes they are. Nice and quiet.
2912,Does this come with a case or anything? How do you carry it around?,"It does not come with a case, you would need to purchase one if you need to carry it around with you. The stand folds flat so it should be easy to carry."
2913,Who repairs SBA15 Deura.  Mine failed and now has only very loud white noise and rumbling with no input.  The controls have no effect.  HELP!,I just change my compression horn but your problem am not sure about it but you can by parts and do it your self
2914,how does the cover for the keyboard of the PX 850 work?,"About an inch above privia emblem you'll notice a gap approx 1/3"" wide (running length of keyboard), which your fingers can fit in and pull out.  You'll also notice grooves on either end of the piano that the cover will stay in as it pulls out.  Hope this helps"
2915,Is there a stand included for your music book?,"Yes, there is a music stand that you can attach to the keyboard."
2916,dose it come with a string retainer bar,"No, our this item don't come with a string retainer bar."
2917,where do you mount the pickup,"This device or preamp,  is flushmounted on the side of the acustic guitar and the sensor is situated under the sandle  . For more information send me your tel number and I'll send you pictures of the actual instalation"
2918,"How much weight can they hold? I'm looking at using them with JBL 8"" monitors, which are pretty large and heavy.","They're great with weight. I have large 8"" monitors on mine and they hold up very well. They are locking so you can pretty much put whatever you want on them."
2919,Is their a place to put a strap on it?,"it has one peg on the bottom, and your supposed to use the kind of strap that ties around the head at the top but i dont like those so i went to a music store and bout another peg (about 3 dollars) and then i just put it where it would normally go, u just screw it in. any guitar store will do it for u for like 5 bucks if you dont want to do it yourself. so in short yes there is a place to put the strap just not the normal one. but for the price of this guitar your not going to beat this deal it sounds good, and you can plug it into an amp if you need to."
2920,does it provide full upgraded sera to?,You are provided the full version of Serato. Recently was able to update without cost so it's pretty solid software.
2921,"I dont understand why they are not posting max weight? My Sunfire subwoofer is 48Lbs, dimensions are 11.5"" cube. Will it be able to support the sub?","This model is made for studio monitors, not subwoofers. You would need to get the IsoAcoustics ISO-L8R200Sub model that holds up to 75lbs. Here is the information on it: http://www.isoacoustics.com/isol8r200sub.php. Thanks!"
2922,Product Dimensions: 16 x 6 x 12 inches ？！ how tall is this bag actually? 16 inches?,That can't be right but I don't have exact dimensions. Fits a strat and an SG fine but a little snug
2923,What strings are on this?,"I don't know what kind of strings but they are decent.  If you are new to the guitar, you will probably want to replace them with some light gauge 'silk and steel' strings, which will be easier on your fingers."
2924,Will the 400mA section power a Radial Tonebone?,"The best thing is to call or write Voodoo Lab. There are too many variables to it.  They always answered my questions both by phone and email. This is the best way to get advice from the makers, not someone from the internet. Too many people have an opinion instead of electrical engineering facts. Call Voodoo."
2925,"Is this guitar too ""much"" (in terms of price) for a beginner? I want something nice and I have full intentions of sticking w/ it and taking care of it","I teach guitar lessons, primarily to kids, and this is always a tricky question.  If you can afford $300, then this is a guitar that you will never outgrow.  It is an excellent instrument, in build quality, sound and playability.  Many parents don't want to spend ""too much"" on a beginner guitar, but if you get something too cheap, then you may have an instrument that's unplayable, doesn't tune properly or just isn't fun to play.  I've been playing for 30+ years and recently purchased one of these Epiphone Hummingbirds.  Mine was pretty much perfect out of the box and I couldn't be more pleased.  Just a beautiful looking and sounding guitar, and so much fun to play.  The pickup sounds good, too, which is a nice bonus.  You may or may not have plans to ever perform or plug it in, but that may change in the future.

2927,Is there only a fine tuner on the E string or the other strings too?,"There's four for all the GDAE strings, and two extra that comes with it for your convenience. But note that you should oil it every now and then if you're in a humid environment as its quite vulnerable to rust as I've experienced."
2928,When flap is open are there magnets that keep it in place?  Some cases use an elastic strap to wrap around the cover to keep it in place.,No it doesnt.
2929,Is the Scarlett Studio package small enough to fit in a regular sized wheeled travel bag ?,Yes
2930,could you email me the instructions and wiring diagram? Thank you in advance!,Mine didn't include any.
2931,"One of the reviews wrote, ""..you can only use around 3 Plugin sounds per project.""  What?  Each project is limited to three plugins?",We never used it.   I'll sell you mine cheap.  It's sitting on my shelve.   Yeagerobert-gmail.com
2932,"What powers this looper, 9V battery, 110ac plug in?  Is everything included to make it work out of the box?","It uses a wall wart, I guess cuz the box is too small for all the electronics and a battery.  Adapter is not included."
2933,Would I be able to hook this up to my Canon t3i? And is this good in large crowds/at events? Looking to do interviews at a large outdoors event.,"There are several ways to use this with a t3i. The easiest (and worst) way is to get an XLR cable that terminated on the other end to 1/8 inch jack. Your better bet would be using a pocket audio recorder like the Zoom H4n. The audio will be very clean, you just need to sync the audio and video in post using either Final Cut Pro's built in audio sync or using Pluraleyes software (I prefer pluraleyes). The other option is to get an XLR preamp adapter like a JuicedLink or Beechtek. Like the first option, you are held back by the substandard audio recorded within the camera itself. These cameras take awesome pictures, but their audio is not that great. Do yourself a favor and get an H4n or Tascam dr60d. Your production quality will skyrocket, and you'll be able to use professional microphones like the Rode Reporter, Rode Lavaliere, and Rode NTG 2 or NTG3. Don't get the camera-top microphones. Save that for a camera-top LED light.

2939,"If I plug these into a switch controlled wall outlet and had them set to a color - Will they stay that color when I flip off and on, or ""reset""?","While I do not have a switch controlled wall outlet, anytime I turn the lights off then back on they are the same color as before. (i.e. have them set to red, turn off, then back on, still red)"

2943,Recommended system requirements?,I use a MacBook Pro with i7 2.3 GHZ processor and 8GB of RAM. I use it as a plug-in with Pro Tools and rarely have any problems or freezes. NI recommends at least an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and at least 4GB of RAM.

2948,"How's the bass on these? Need to add a sub in addition or do they produce a good, full-spectrum of sound by themselves?","Depends on what you are trying to do. I used mine for a wedding of 150 people and everyone though it was great. I have a friend who uses it as the speaker for his electric bass he plays in a dance band and it works just fine. If you have a 5000 sq. ft. room with 500 people you will need a sub. It may be only 200 watts rms and 1000watts peak, but outdoors cranked up, run by a line in from the headphone jack of a tablet, you can hear it clearly a block away. Use it in your living room and it will cause hearing damage."

It is a wonderful DAC for the price especially paired up with an O2 or Magni but sadly it probably will not be able to work on Android phones at least for the time being. If you do want a DAC similar to the Modi in price range and performance try looking up the Objective DAC (ODAC), NuForce uDAC 2, or if you want to be really portable try looking at say the E18 from Fiio. All are mostly in the same price category as this device and do work with the Galaxy S3 and S4.

2952,Does this unit have the new updated software in it?,"not sure how one tells if the software is new or not.  It plays music as it should.  If you order extra song chips, spend the time to look at the actual song lists from the manufacturer - there's a lot of overlap.  Its surprisingly difficult to get the songs you want!"
2953,Is this a single speaker or a pair?,One speaker. The pic is of the front and back view.
2954,I assume this supply's Phantom power but does it supply 48V Because my AT2020 XLR takes 48V,"I am using a MXL 770 with it which also requires 48V and it works great. So, yes."
2955,Does this have a USB port to plug in and charge your bluetooth device?,Yes. I plug my phones USB cable right into the port and rock out with the Bluetooth all night. You can also plug it into the auxiliary port.
2956,will this stand hold the blue yeti mic and a pop filter?,"YES it will!  That's the only way I use it.  You will need to do a little trial-and-error with where you screw the pop filter onto the stand, since you don't want it to interfere with the arm's movement.  If you get everything attached and it seems too heavy, just tighten up the knob at the ""elbow"" joint.  Works perfectly for me.  Hope this helps!"

What all would he need to add to this?","This would be an AWESOME gift for a 15 year old DJ. The only thing that he would need is a pair of speakers, a pair of headphones and some cables. Thanks."
2961,"does the kit include a power supply that can be connected directly to 120V AC outlet? Can the remote make all LED ""bulb"" give yellow lights?","Hello,  1， this item is without power supply, so you need to prepare a 2A 12V power supply. You can refer to Lemonbest® 24Watt 12V 2A AC Power Supply Adapter US Plug AC100-245V to DC 12V  2，this remote can only control led strips, and cannot control bulbs.  Thank you!"
2962,What kind of power supply do I need to get with this pedal?,Any standard 9 volt pedal power supply will work.  The OneSpot works well. The key is that pedals use a negative center connector.  That means the center part of the connector is negative and the outer ring it positive.
2963,What cable do I need for I pad air?,"The IRig comes with three cables, lighting adapter the 32 pin and the usb.  So works with new iOS old iOS and USB to computers."
2964,Does this boxed version come with a printed manual or just the disk?,Mine had a very short manual.  I learned more from Youtube clips
2965,can this play mp3,"Hi,It all depends on the source - these can play sound form any device - MP3, CD, vinyl etc ...it all depends on the device you are hooking up. Please let me know if that answers your question or if there is anything else I can do,My very best,JenniferMillennium Worldwide"
2966,Is this  strong enough to check as luggage with an airline? Am better off with this or a Yamaha HC-AG1 Hardshell Vinyl? Weight of either?,My son flew from Seattle to Norfolk VA and his guitar did fine in this case... it also locks so that is a bonus
2967,Will this work with 12V AC?,"No, only DC"
2968,"I have a mic with a mount, can I detatch the the mic mount that is on the stand and put on the mount that came with the mic?",Yes you can. It struggles a little with an re-20. But handles it ok
2969,"Does it have a magnet to hold the cover shut or a strap. If a strap, does the strap stretch out quickly?","It has a strap, I have only had it for a month and doesn't seem to be any less tight."
2970,Does this keyboard have a transpose feature?,Yes. Up or down in 12 semi-tone steps.
2971,What is this for?  Improving sound quality?,"This device improves sound quality by helping prevent the impact of ""plosives."" These are low-frequency noises created when certain words such as ""pop"" or ""box"" are spoken. (Look up the definition of ""plosive"" on Wikipedia.) These create a brief pressure wave that impacts the microphone with enough force as to create a ""boom"" or ""thump"" sound. The actual impact heard depends on the microphone, the bass response of the system, the distance to the sound source, and the overall volume level. Some people speak with more plosive impact than others. Condenser microphones such as the Blue Yeti are particularly sensitive to plosives because of their low frequency response and the sensitivity of the diaphragm that generates the sound in the mic. The Yeti in particular has a tremendous low frequency response and must be used with some type of ""pop"" filter to avoid these ""thumps"" if the sound source is closer than a foot or so, depending on the volume of the source. A foam pop filter is often used on hand-held mics, but these can slightly degrade high-frequency response. For studio or desktop mics, a fine fabric or metal screen is used. Though these, particularly some metal ones, can modify the sound slightly, this is preferable to the harsh thumps created by plosives. Another benefit of pop filters is that they also prevent small droplets of ""spit"" from entering the microphone. When you're dealing with a mic that costs hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars, this is very important.
