1,difference between meat cure and pickling salt,"Pickling salt is a very pure form of salt. A meat cure contains sodium nitrate (like .05%), sodium nitrite(also .05%) and salt.

19,I only received 11 not 12 in the box just delivered.  Why?,"I had the same experience with this seller. Box was open, one of the bottles was missing. Contact Amazon, they will want to know something is amiss."
20,"Sugar free Oreo - Sweetener? What's the sweetener used in this product? Consumers would want to know. For instance, I'd buy it if they used Splenda. Would not if they used Malitol.","These are indeed Sweetened with Malitol.  I don't know about you but I am exteremely sensitive to Malitol.  So, I don't recommend them"

25,What's the difference between Crown Prince NATURAL in olive oil (white box) and Crown Prince in Olive oil (Blue box)?,"According to their website there isn't a qualitative difference. Both varieties have the same listed properties, including: wild caught, 1.7 g omega-3, and BPA free cans."
26,I'm on a clear liquid diet and will have to be a few more times in the future. Are the drops clear or colored?,"It depends on which one you get, some are clear (like grape and berry) and some have coloring (like toffee).

You only need a few drops, this is a very concentrated product that goes a long way."

47,How much sodium is there in this product?,"Pursuant to reading the side of the can, other than the listing of a few ingredients (e.g., lemon, paprika, salt, pepper...), it does NOT provide the amount of miligrams with regard to sodium.  As a Hungarian who assumes normally a ""no-added salt"" diet to keep me from retaining fluid in my legs, I do not taste a huge amount as opposed to the amount of paprika, which I can assume safely should be no more 100 mg per serving.  I must add; however, that the rub REALLY enhances the flavor of not only fish (e.g., which is what I purchased the product for) but also beef and fowl.  I hope I answered your question to your expectations.  I recommend trying to conduct an Internet search on ""amount of sodium in Szeged fish rub"" or their website to try to obtain additional nutritional information.  Sorry that I could not provide you with a better answer more relative to what you were seeking exactly--that's an excellent question.

49,How does this compare to Teavana's German Rock Sugar?,"I personally have not purchased Teavana's German Rock Sugar but I have done some research.  Research indicates both are from beat sources.  NOW beet sugar is in a form similar to cane sugar but is actually a little sweeter.  The Teavana sugar is in a much larger crystal form that takes much longer to dissolve.  I was not able to confirm if the color difference (white for NOW, brownish for Teavana) was due to less processing of the Teavana sugar or additives.  The NOW brand foods are not genetically modified according to their website http://www.nowfoods.com/Quality/our-non-gmo-commitment.htm, however, I saw research that indicated the Teavana sugar was from genetically modified sources.  I can not confirm or deny this statement as I was unable to confirm its authenticity.  But with a higher price and the lack of data on ingredients, I chose to go with the NOW foods beet sugar.

51,"What is the source for this, corn or birch?  Where was this manufactured?","I emailed the company and this is what they said:  The xylitol in our products is derived from the fibrous or woody parts of Non-Gmo corn stalks and cobs. There is no corn kernel in the xylitol, so those with allergies to corn have no reaction to it. It is also casein and gluten free. Because there is no grain in the product, there are absolutely no micro-toxins found in our xylitol (It is tested for such impurities in the manufacturing process and as a finished product). The corn-derived xylitol does not require hydrogenation, like xylitol from birch trees, and since it comes from a renewable source we're able to keep it affordable for our customers. Our Xylitol is manufactured in China. We are aware of the concerns that people have with products being made in China, so we do take extra precautions. We package all of our products here in the U.S. so we are able to inspect them before packaging. The FDA also inspects and approves. We also send a couple of our representatives to China around 6 times a year to check on the facilities. I can assure you that all of our products are safe to use. It is the pharmaceutical grade and is at least 99.8% pure.

52,Is this product vegan?,It has non dairy creamer.
53,How similar in taste is this to Good Earth Original Sweet & Spicy tea?,"I am unfamiliar with Good Earth but I think this is a very unique flavor.  The Harney Hot Cinnamon (regular tea or herbal) is a very intense sweet cinnamon flavor-  it doesn't burn but it sweetens the beverage, as if you had added honey.  The orange notes are subtle rounding out the flavor and the black tea flavor is ever so noticeable.   I am totally addicted to the flavor/sweeteness.  If you have never tasted it and like/love a strong (not subtle) cinnamon flavor it is worth a try."
54,does the pot keep coffee hot,"Hello fellow Amazon buyer!  I have this coffee pot and like it a lot. I pour boiling water into the porcelain pot before making coffee.  The pot heats up and when I am ready to pour through, I empty the hot water from the pot into my coffee cup.  The result is coffee that is actually hotter than coffee made in electric coffee pots that are boiling water drop by drop.  In electric pots, the water loses the heat rapidly.  So, it is possible to get a very hot, fresh cup of coffee from the Melitta.  However, the heat does dissipate.  I use a dishtowel to cover the pot if any coffee is going to sit for a while.  I hope that I have answered your question!  I do recommend the coffee maker.

60,How much caffeine is in one Ferrero Pocket Coffee chocolate?,It takes three pieces to equal one shot of espresso.
61,How much stock does it actually make?  For example--some bases you use 1 tsp. for 1 cup of water....,"The base can make a variable amount of stock, depending upon how concentrated you need it.  The package says it can be used as dilute as one part base to 40 (yes 40) parts water or as strong as full strength.  At the diluted strength it can make up to 5 gallons of stock.  It is very reasonable, and tasty diluted.  I haven't tried it full strength."

Just wondering if I should avoid taking this in the evening.,"Go to the company's website FAQs and ""What are the differences between Green SuperFoods?""

64,most oils need no refridgeration after opening.  does red palm oil need refridgeration?,"Hi, Cat! No, the palm oil doesn't need refrigeration after opening. It can be kept at room temperature. In fact, it is easier to take it out of the jar this way. Make sure you eat it RAW, not cooked. High temperature destroys all the active ingredients, i.e. the many antioxidants it contains. I know customers reported cooking with it which is not advisable because of the reason I just gave. The taste is quite strange, to say the least. However, I found that, mixed in equal parts with spicy mustard, it can be eaten spread on toast, or on potatoes or pasta. I hope this helped! Lucretia"

66,what is the source material?  My sister-in-law can only have xylitol derived from birch.,"Usually, if it doesn't say birch it isn't. It's made from corn and probably comes from China. Birch is more expensive but worth it to me."
67,What are the ingredients?,I believe that it is 100% juice. I have heard that the actual authentic key lime became extinct a few decades ago. But whatever this is tastes wonderful. I used it for my version of key lime pie with sweetened condensed milk.

The Napa is tomatoe and basil favored.  It's really good- well on anyting.  As for the the French, it's tarragon and dill base.  It's good on chicken and fish.  The Italian is okay in comparison to the other two.  So, I highly recommand the three pack.  Favor your food with the French and Napa while saving the Italian for the salad dressings."
77,Is your oat flour gleutin free?,Yes
78,What is a good way to store this so I can make sure it doesn't go bad or get infested with food moths?,"I store mine in the freezer in airtight containers.

80,can i use illy pod in nespresso machine,"No: Nespresso uses its own proprietary pods, while Illy iperespresso capsules can only be used in coffee machines made for iperespresso: most of these are branded Illy, although Gaggia also makes a good and relatively cheap one.  By the way, I'm familiar with both systems: in  my opinion nespresso coffee is very different from a real Italian Espresso, has an excess of foam (not the ""crema"" typical of espresso) which tastes somewhat sweet and sticky.  Iperespresso, on the other hand, is very close to a traditional espresso, maybe slightly less hot and with a tad more bitter aftertaste but still quite like the real thing.  This, of course, is just my opinion and may differ from yours, but be sure to taste both before you buy: they are really very different products.

86,what other equipment do I need to buy for this kit?,"depending on where you live, I would look at a wine starter kit on Midwest supply.com or Amazon. This gives you all the things you need to make wine.  Hoe much wine are you planning  on making. If you are only going to make a few kits here and there, these beginner kits will be good enough. If you plan on making kits on a regular basis, I would upgrade the kit to include a floor corker. I also prefer the glass carboys to plastic, but they are also much heavier especially when full of wine. I really found everything I needed and the best prices at Midwest supply.com. They allow you to upgrade items in the kits and often give you a better deal than buying individually. I think I spent about $350. That will get you started. I make fruit wine from fresh fruit and have made about 30 of the vino italiano kits. I bought more carboys and fermentation buckets so I could do multiple wines at a time. Hope this helps

87,I ordered the 4 pack in July and it was about $25.  Now it's nearly $50????  Really?,Me too...Now $55.00.  Check out Bob's...It's not organic but very comparable with taste.
88,Can you use the initial batch of kefir to make a new batch using raw milk? and what would be the proportions?,"Yes.  I've done it for months.  With a fork scrape off some curds off the top, about a 1/2 cup or more. (It takes a couple of days to get it going well.) Put them in the bottom of a clean quart jar and add freshly milked, warm milk over it.  Keep at room temperature for 24 hrs.  It has really improved our health."
89,How much caffeine compared to a regular coffee?,"I think they say there's no reduction in caffeine compared with regular instant coffees, just a reduction in acid. I notice no difference in caffeine myself...""feels"" the same as regular, just no stomach issues."
90,"Is it me or has PG Tips changed in flavor?  It's not the same as it used to be, different blend now? Not as good.","It's not your imagination.  Been drinking PG Tips for decades (I used to carry it back from Europe in pre-internet ordering days). It is definitely not what it used to be.  I've tried several boxes on the assumption I must have gotten a bad batch, but three bad boxes in a row, several months apart, and have sadly come to the conclusion that they changed the blend.   Sadness!  I'm abandoning the brand."
91,does this item have alcohol in it?,"Almost all extracts contain alcohol. They do not put it in for their benefit, as it obviously costs more than water! The reason that almost all extracts use alcohol is that some flavors simply don't dissolve in water, so if you soak vanilla beans in just water, you are not getting some of the many flavor compounds out of the beans. Same with cooking, alcohol dissolves some flavors that water alone will not, so many recipes call for a little alcohol to 'carry' the flavors."
92,"says 16 count, pack of 3, so 16x3 = 48, then brings 48 capsules??",In the cappuccino there are 8 milk capsules and 8 espresso capsules per box. So in a pack of three boxes there are a total of 48 capsules but that comes out to 24 cappuccino's.
93,"Are the cans BPA free, thanks.",this is from Mother Jones: Valley Fresh White Chicken in Water Organic 0.19 Less than Limithttp://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/08/bpa-in-canned-foods
94,When it says the quantity is16 count-pack of three. So how many pods total(48?) are in the shipment?,"Yes, there are 3 boxes with 16 pods each.  Most of the ""regular"" Baronet flavors come 18 to a box, so this is more expensive per serving. I think it's worth it."
95,Is it really unsweetened?  No other fruit juice sweeteners?,"Yep. Nothing but cranberry in there. I mix one bottle of this with 4C water & 1.5C sugar, but I like it strong. Lakewood does make a cranberry cocktail (or some such) that's sweetened with juice from other fruits, but this one's straight-up cranberry."
96,Is the honey in a glass or plastic jar?,It is in a plastic jar.
97,Does this product come in a glass or in a plastic container?,Plastic container
98,"If baking them on top of a breakfast casserole @ 350 degrees, how long do they need to bake to just set the whites?","Ive never made that recipe. I boil them for 5 minutes for hard boiled eggs. If you want the centers set but not hard, perhaps 3 minutes?I imagine you can watch them closely in the oven and decide on the spot."
99,are these non gmo?,"I would contact the ""Sincerely Nuts"" to find out for sure. However, they are marked Kosher and the National Kosher Certification Program has banned since 04/2013 any GMO foods from receiving the K Kosher label to be phased out and completed by 2014.......Hope this bit of info helps. P.S. These are the best dates I have EVER tasted!!!"

101,is it made in usa,"Yes, it appears it is made under ""Xylitol USA Inc."" in Aurora, Colorado, and if you do a search on the web for Emerald Forest Xylitol it says that it is one of the few manufacturers in North America."
102,Could I use it for SUEDE LEATHER ? Or What is Bick's product for SUEDE LEATHER ? Thank you.,"Christine, I use it on suede as well.  For example, I soaked a pair of suede shoes in the rain.  Used Bicks 5 on them and brought them back to life [like new].  The shoes were darkened a bit at first, but later returned to their original color.  I love this stuff.  Threw my Lexol leather treatment away when I found this."
103,Contain soy?,Yes.
104,About how many per package?,It's difficult for me to remember but I'll hazard a guess of 10 - 15 per bag . They were individually wrapped which worked out well for us. I recall ordering a box full of them and thus we had more than we needed. Hope that this helpful. The product was well made as far as I could tell.
105,Does this product contain MSG?,"Yes, it does. I'm reading it right off the label."
106,Does it need refrigeration before opened?,"I don't think it needs it. I put it in the fridge as soon as I got it though. by the way, it is very good. I will buy it again."
107,can you capsule it,I bought it for my daughter-in-law.  She grinds it in a magic bullet type blender into a powder.  I would think you could put it into capsules.
108,Does anyone have the nutritional information for these crackers?,"Reading from the back of the box...Serving size 15 crackers, Calories 140, Total Fat 5g, Sat Fat 0.5g, Trans Fat 0g, Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 110mg, Total Carb 20g, Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 0g, Protein 3g. Ingredients: brown rice meal, sesame seeds, potato starch, quinoa seeds, safflower oil, flax seeds, amaranth seeds, tamari soy sauce powder (tamari soy sauce soybeans, salt), maltodextrin (corn), salt. Contains SOY."
109,Are these in the original box package?,Yes. Individual boxes
110,What is the size of this?,"I put it on a 9"" round cake, but it was just a little too big - would have been fine on a 10"" diameter cake. If I remember correctly, the ends of the swords just barely curved over the edge of the cake. It looked great even though it didn't fit perfectly. I can't remember the exact dimensions of the design. Hope this helps."
111,Has anyone tried drinking this iced/chilled? Does it still taste appealing? Thank you!,It is good cold too. Normally I drink it hot in the mornings though.
112,how much sodium,The label says 360 mg sodium in a 1/2 cup serving.
113,Can you use this to bulk up low carb baking?,"Yes, you can.  You might want to experiment a little as to how much you use. There is no taste to it, but it is a good filler and bulking agent that helps with appetite and filling full faster. You can experiment with spices or use in place of corn starch and flour in your receipes. That in of itself will bring the carb content to a much lower level. If your just looking for more help with portion control add it to your regular receipes.  I would experiment a to see how your intestines handle it, especially if you are  not use to eating high fiber or have maybe are someone who had weight loss surgery, particularly as a supplement and build up from there. it is very filling without that gritty fiber texture. It also helps with satiety and to some degree blood sugar.  Hope this helps answer your question. :)

116,"If bought now, spring, would it bloom this season?","Yes, while nothing flowers year round, spring and early summer bloom is expected and should do so shortly this year."
117,how do you cook shirataki noodles & do you drain liquid and rinse first?,"Yes, drain them first and cook them for a few minutes."
118,Is organic arrowroot powder the same as organic tapioca starch?,"Tapioca is Cassava root, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca and Arrowroot is from the same plant, but apparently more often from other plants - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowroot  Hope this helps!"
119,Is this fruit grown in USA or other coutries?  Is it prepared in USA or just packaged in USA?,"Yes.  In the ""about us"" description under the ""about the seller"".  It states all fruits are grown in California.  Hope this helps."
120,If i want to put a pinch or 2 on 500 cupcakes how many cartoons should i order?,"2 is plenty. Don't use your fingers use. Small paint brush, dip it in the dust, hold it over the cupcake and flick the stem of the brush with a finger from the opposite hand. It will go way farther."
121,Is it from raw or roasted sesame seeds?,The seeds are roasted before being pressed.
122,How many fruit berry tablets come in the box?,"Ten.  I cut 'em in two to make twenty.  Seems to work fine.  Just remember that the effect lasts for hours, so during that time, other dishes taste different.  That's why I only use them for dessert--after the main dinner."
123,are there any sulfites in the processing?,not to my knowledge. i just wonder if raisins arent as beneficial as well as less expensive

126,What extra equipment do you need to purchase in order to make the finished product?,"Don't know what you have, Nicole.  Assuming you are starting from scratch you will need the ""wine making hardware"" which can be purchased from Amazon or at your local Wine/Beer making hobby shop.  That includes 1 six gallon carboy (really need two), a hydrometer, floating thermometer, stirring paddle, six gallon fermenting bucket, corking tool, wine ""trap"" to perform hydrometer readings, air lock (preferably 2), 6' of clear tubing.  In addition to these basics I'd recommend an auto syphon.  Once completed you will need bottles which can be purchased or have someone you know at a pub to save their wine bottles for you....remove labels (recommend removing with hot water, then run cold water over the glued area and remove hardened glue with a single edge razor blade.  Rinse in super hot water then sanitize before filling.  This kit will make 30 bottles (750ml) or 15 of the 1.5 liter.  I like to fill some of both.

127,Does it product contain other ingredients such as aluminum? Or is it just Sodium Bicarbonate?,"Good question! This is always a concern of mine as well since I use it for a lot of natural remedies, health & beauty, household cleaning & deodorizing, as well as ingesting it in different ways ranging from baking to alkalizing water.... I have contacted Arm & Hammer personally in the past because there ARE brands that contain aluminum, as well as sometimes a company can get away with not listing it due to such miniscule amounts. Arm & Hammer baking soda absolutely does NOT contain aluminum. Hope this answered your question thoroughly!"
128,Looking for Organic and gluten free.  Are these organic as well?,"Hi Kathy! My husband and I try to stick with organic and gluten-free as well, however, being that Bob's Red Mill is such a great brand and they don't use GMO products I have overlooked the fact that this particular product is not organic. That being said, if you're really stuck on getting a product that is gluten free and organic maybe check out the Bob's Red Mill website and see if they have what you need? Hope that helps! :)"

I believe he was actually interviewed for the program. If you read Ralph's newletters, he strikes me as a man with integrity, but that is my personal opinion as is my love for his teas"

The first ingredient is: sugar, followed by water, distilled vinegar, soy sauce, food starch-modified, contains less than 2% of salt, spices, xanthan gum and natural flavors.  No MSG added except for that naturally occurring in soy sauce.  Hope this helps."
131,"Are the salt granules like that of regular table salt, or finer like that of powdered sugar?",They are really fine so they stick nicely to the popcorn. And I usually use a little bit of butter spray on it so then the fine salt really sticks well! It's the best popcorn salt I've found since the French-sounding popcorn salt I used to buy! (I can't remember the name of it; I used to buy it online but they discontinued it!)
132,"any acid in product ,please?","Not sure since purchased last year. I did not enjoy the product; would not purchase again. I am currently using sensitive skin baby wipes, travel size and large container at home."

135,How many Tablespoons or Cups are in 16 oz (1 lb) of sprinkles?,"It's not an apples to apples comparison since one is a measure of weight/mass and the other is volume. However, I weighed a 1/3 cup of sprinkles and it was 2.5 ounces. Hope that helps."

143,i have seen one my friend has one...is it worth buying?,"We are in Montreal Canada. It was not sent in the jar that shows here but rather in 2 plastic vats. Aesthetically, this was awful as my grandson wanted what shows in the picture on line. The contents were good. The shipping was an additional 70 some $ so the entire cost came to over $140. But the big disappointment was the absence of the 11 llb. Nutella jar logo and all. It changed a gift into a utility package."
144,"I ordered this, but there was no dry ice in the box.  It was melted and leaking.  Why?","Did it sit out for awhile before you opened it? As soon as it is delivered, I unpack it -- which is problem if it gets delivered while you are at work! I would contact the company though, they ARE AWESOME and respond QUICKLY to any issues."

148,what is the best buy date on your current batch?,14-May-15
149,why did the price increase more than double from my last order?,"The higher price listed over $12.99 is when Tim Hortons is out of stock and the other seller (not Tim Hortons) is set as the default seller. For some reason amazon runs out of stock and then after a few weeks its back. I always order 4 bags at a time so I don't run out. I really wish they had a subscribe and save agreement with Tim Hortons. After switching to Eight O'Clock beans for a number of months, I found that Sam's Club carries this 2pound Tim Horton's product in their stores for $12.88 per bag.

151,Why are you charging $18.89 when they only cost $6.97 per box at Costco???,"Anita, how much is a Costco membership?  How far is the closest Costco? How much time does it take to drive to Costco?

My wife and love them. Have a great day!"

163,"I don't do sugar, does this coconut milk have sugar in it?",No this coconut milk doesn't have any added sugar.
164,"1. Shelf life? (i.e., 5 - 25 yr. emerg. food storage?)  2. Refrigeration required/suggested?","They actually suggest refrigeration, but I order these in bulk in 25 lb boxes and store them in a large kitchen cabinet, and I can attest that they last at least a year.  I would like to put some in my food storage but haven't tried it yet. I think if they're dry packed in foil pouches or buckets with an O2 pack, they would probably last quite a while.  The big threat would be rancidity, but since they have a very low fat content, I think they'd be OK.  I can't see why they'd be any different than TVP."
165,"What are the 7 grains included?? I would never buy a product like this without knowing what 7 grains we are talking about.

Show Less","My label showed 50G of carb and 29 fiber as well and 2 sugars.  At first I thought what I got was sweetened, but after tasting it, it was not sweet.  Very sad that they are putting nutrition labels on the product that are just plain wrong."
174,Is this organic?,"I cant' really say but I buy it for my grandson because my daughter makes his formula with it and it does state that it has ""No BGH Antibiotics or Preservatives"". That to us is very important. Hope this helps."

178,Can I order a Kombucha Starter now as a Christmas Gift? How long will it last in it's current state?,"Hi Jessica,This should be a perfect time to order a starter kit as the weather is cool and Scobies go dormant when they are cold, so it is better shipping weather for them. Just make sure you have all your jars & tea & everything, (as my scoby came in a plastic zip-lock...)  Keep the scoby and starter tea refrigerated until you give it away, as at room temperature it will keep fermenting.  Your kit will probably come with good instructions but it will help if you read up on it first, especially if the gift recipient is new to Kombucha (which I didn't so I brewed my first batch rather blindly...:-))  My favorite web sight with really clear instructions is royalkombucha.com., I learned a lot there.Hope this helps - what a great gift idea - I LOVE my Kombucha!

179,Which bag has the calcium? The white or brown? I threw out the box. Ugh.,"I bought the big quantity so in the box I'm not sure.  However, the pectin is in a much bigger quantity than the calcium (since you only need a small amount to mix up) and I'd imagine it would be similar with the box.  You can check with Pomona's web site and see if they have the answer.  I will say that it is the best pectin and I've had great success with making jelly with it.  Not needing so much sugar makes the fruit taste really strong.  Yum!!!"
180,is this the same as red palm fruit oil?,Amazon asked me to help you. I bought this oil for the first time because Google show me is the same I used in Brazil to cook lots of Brazilian food.

181,How many truffles in each box?,"Honestly, I don't have any idea.  Since they were all melted (and this was for a Xmas present) then I wouldn't have been able to count them anyway.  I would not recommend them - they are not packaged appropriately and I didn't find them very flavorful."

184,I would like organic and gluten free polenta. Is this gluten free?,"Since corn is the only grain involved in grits (and, hence, polenta), any brand of grits should be gluten-free.  Even my gluten-sensitive daughter consumes these grits.In addition, Bob's Red Mill site specifies their grits are gluten-free.So, while I can't run scientific tests and guarantee it myself, I'd say, yes, Bob's corn grits is a gluten-free product.By the way, in order to make polenta from grits -- this is assuming you don't already know -- cook the grits per directions, and then pour them in to some shaped container.  Let them cool to room temperature, then refrigerate, covered (of course).  Cut into chunks, pan-fry, and serve with eggs and bacon, eggs and sausage, or however you want it.Hope all this blather helps.

238,Does it contain any nutrients?,"I agree, it's still sugar so you shouldn't eat a lot of it. But they do say that it has Iron, Zinc, Calcium and Potassium, along with some short chain fatty acids, polyphenols and antioxidants that may also provide some health benefits. It also contains Inulin, which may slow glucose absorption. It has a lower glycemic index than regular table sugar too. But again, it is sugar. So use in moderation. I wouldn't use this as a source to add iron, zink, or any of the other minerals to your diet. You can those in much healthier ways."

253,Is this black rice the glutinous sticky kind or is it non-glutinous?  I'm looking for a non-glutinous black rice if possible.,"Not sure but what I DO Know is that the only rice that is natural is Wild Rice (long grain). Any other rice white, brown, black ect. ect. is a hybrid & contains starch. In the cooking process the starch tends to get sticky that's why white rice especially tends to stick to the sides and bottom of the pot. Out of all hybrid rice black rice is the least starchy but I would just buy the wild rice because the molecular structure is complete because its native to the earth (meaning it was found by man not made by man)Wild Rice is starchless (well at least the Non GMO kind)"

257,Any idea about how many cookies per pound box?,I would estimate it to be probably around 10-15 of them.
258,replacement for blanched almond flour?,"No, although it could be used for dredging (coating), but it does have a sweet taste.  Coconut flour is much more absorbent than almond flour.  The amount of flour used would need to be decreased or the liquids increased, which affects the entire recipe.  It's usually easier to use an existing recipe (unless you really like to experiment with recipes)."
259,Are these nut free?  It seems many pumpkin seeds have the disclaimer that they could contain traces of peanuts...,"No, it says on the label that peanuts are processed in the same facility."
260,Has anyone tried this on the Keurig Rivo?,No I only use the pods on my Nescafe Dolce Gusto DeLonghi machine. Sorry I can't help you.

Just wanted to make sure there was no dye added to these (bought a diff brand that made the water turn black),"I first would like to state that Organic Traditions is a reputable company, that being said I usually just use these straight out of the bag, I store mine in the refrigerator to protect the delicate oil in them. I do not was my seeds and I have not sprouted these as of yet."
269,"I see that these have cellulose in them, which is essentially a long chain of glucose molecules. Does this mean sugar intake? Thanks for any answers!","Cellulose is a starch, which is an important structural component for plants. It is a complex glucose chain, but we do not have the enzymes to digest it. Our livestock do, however, and that is why they thrive on grass. For us, it is a form of dietary fiber, and therefore, does fulfill some important nutritional roles."
270,Are the soybeans non GMO?,"Yes, the ones used in this brand are."
271,What's the shelflife of wild rice ?,I am not sure because I always keep mine in the frig and that way it keeps forever and stays fresh.
272,Does it come in the plastic container in the picture?  Or a bag?,Mine came in a plastic bag.
273,what is the expiration date on the containers?,Guess it depends on when you buy it?????? Mine are long gone.
274,"I assume one pod is equivalent to one shot of espresso. Is this correct, or can they make multiple? I'm asking since I usually drink a three-shot 16oz",One pod doesn't give you very much. Maybe one and a half shots? If that.
275,Is the container glass or plastic?,Glass
276,I am fully aware the noodles are Indonesian. My question is WHERE are they actually MADE?,"They are made in Jakarta, Indonesia. I will try to upload a picture so you can see what is printed in the back of the packaging."
277,"is this 2 pounds, or 3.5 pounds?  anyone check?",3.5 lbs of quality grits. These have become the only grits we'll buy.
278,Is there any perfumes added to this product?  I am looking for non-perfumed cocoa butter for baking.,no perfume.I use this for my skin because I am allergic to perfumes.I tested one piece. They are like white chocolate without sugar
279,How could the shipping weight be 1 pound if this is two pounds?,"Maybe they cut us a deal; I don't know.  However, considering the price of pecans in a grocery store, I figured I came out ahead by ordering these. Haven't ordered for awhile because we are in the process of moving, but I remember thinking that the shipping price wasn't all that much - plus I usually received the pecans VERY quickly.  I've ordered several times from this company and never been disappointed."
280,"I'm confused.  If ""these noodles are composed primarily of soluble fiber"" why does the label state 0 Fiber?","Not really sure. I do know the FDA ruled that if a serving of food is less that 5 calories, companies can label it as 0 calories. Same with sugar and carbs (less than 1g), so maybe fiber they can do the same. Konjac noodles are 97% water and 3% fiber, so that would be my guess.Good question, I never thought about it. I might email miracle noodles and see if I can get an answer.I did just go to their website and saw nutritional information. Carbs is labeled as ""<1g-only fiber."" So I'm thinking they just wanted to label everything as 0 this 0 that for marketing. But there is less than 1g of fiber per serving. Hope that helps.

281,"Is the soy used in this powder, non-GMO?","They don't say anywhere on the package ... so I would assume not non-GMO.  Not sure what your use will be, but for me, what little I am adding to my cooking projects does not concern me.  Good luck!"
282,This box comes with the little spoon that you need to eat them??,Unfortunately it does not. I ordered those seperately at a reasonable price on Amazon.
283,I love the product but the top of the squeeze bottle doesnt always work!  Bottle is not user friendly!!!,"If it's the most recent iteration of the lid that includes the gasket, I've found that the lid has to be on really tight for the concentrate not to squeeze out around the base of the lid."
284,What is the difference in the toddler version and the infant version of Nutramigen?,Toddler has more iron and calcium... as they need more as their bones are hardening.
285,I just feed my baby 1 oz. will the other 2nd oz still be good if I feed my baby in 2-3 hours?,"No, u may feed baby within an hour after opening and then dispose of after that if baby hasnt finished it within that hour time frame."
286,I`m suspicious-why is carbs the only thing they don`t list-sounds like it must be really high in carbs ?,"You are right to be suspicious.  Sadly, this product is no longer low-carb -- it just has more protein and fiber added.  It has 19 total carbs and 16 net carbs.  I don't really see much of a benefit here compared to other cereals that are low in sugar.  The added protein, fiber and lack of sugar may help some people like diabetics have a somewhat more regular blood sugar and feel full for longer.  Also, this cereal is relatively inexpensive and easily found in local grocery stores.  But on the other hand, anyone who is helped by this cereal would probably be helped even more by other cereals that are truly low in carb, with more protein and fiber and less grain, gluten, etc.  There are a fair number of other truly low-carb cereals (I recommend ""Hi-Lo"" or Dixie Diner) that are healthier and taste better, though you would probably need to order them online such as through Amazon, and they tend to be a little to a lot more expensive.  Hi-Lo is only 1 to 2 dollars more, Dixie Diner a bit more.

287,what is the difference between organic and organic cultured ghee?,"The process...One of the traditional processes of making ghee involves culturing the cream before churning it into butter and then clarifying it into ghee. Pure Indian Foods Grass-fed Organic Cultured Ghee is made by following this age-old and time-honored practice. The result is a delightfully aromatic ghee with a slight tangy flavor characteristic of cultured foods. And as always, Pure Indian Foods ghee is made from milk obtained only during the spring and fall when the cows are on the pasture eating rapidly growing fresh, green grass.Why Cultured Ghee?Milk contains lactose, a natural sugar which gives it that delicate sweet taste. In order for the body to breakdown lactose, an enzyme called lactase must be present. Many people lack this valuable enzyme in their digestive system causing a common digestive problem known as lactose intolerance. In order to metabolize lactose, lactase must always be present. During the culturing of milk or cream, lactose is converted into lactic acid. This makes for a much more digestible product for many people. Remember, generally ghee does not cause a problem with lactose intolerance. This is because during the ghee making process, the lactose is removed even if the butter used to make the ghee was not made from fermented cream.

288,Is this flour finer than honeyville brand?,"Yes, I think it is. I compared it to three other brands I had on hand, and it looked to be smaller grain and felt finer when rubbed between my fingers. Honeyville is very good, but Wellbee is the best in my opinion."

292,Is this matcha tea from Japan or China? Thanks,"The package back says it's from China.For that reason I can not recommend this. Food from China do not have adequate safety testing.  The Chinese government has so much corruption and bribery, that any ""testing"" they claim could be faked.  Not worth gambling my family's health on food from China."
293,"The ""best by"" date on the box I just received states ""12-16-03L 120.""So, it looks like Dec.16, 2003, or is it Dec. 2016? Thanks!",I THINK Dec 2016.

296,Can the Vegg be used to coat eggplant slices so that breadcrumbs or flour will stick to them so they can be fried?,"I would not use it for that, it has a very eggy taste.  Try almond milk, then flour, back in milk, breadcrumbs."
297,Is this cacao powder processed with alkali?  I read that if it has been processed with alkali the heart healthy flavanols have been destroyed.,"Hey there! Well, from my research, it is totally raw; that means it is natural, not heated above 118 degrees Fahrenheit, and not processed. You are correct, though, that alkali processed (also called Dutch processed) cacao/cocoa does destroy most of the incredible health benefits of this superfood! (for more info, check out these articles: http://www.life-enhancement.com/magazine/article/2798-effect-of-treating-cocoa-with-alkali-the-dutching-process ; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18710243)"

308,Is it really unsweetened?  No other fruit juice sweeteners?,"Yep. Nothing but cranberry in there. I mix one bottle of this with 4C water & 1.5C sugar, but I like it strong. Lakewood does make a cranberry cocktail (or some such) that's sweetened with juice from other fruits, but this one's straight-up cranberry."

316,"This is a glass bottle, yes?",Yes it is and very nice one
317,How do you use these for cooking (not baking) -- just add water and whisk before putting in the pan?,"Yes, but. . . :  The powder does not like to dissolve in cold (or hot) water, and this causes a problem in ""getting started"".  After the powder actually becomes wet, everything works fine.  Getting it wet is the problem:  one tends to get lumps that are wet on the outside and still dry-powder on the inside.  As a mostly ""pure protein"" such lumps can taste rather disgusting if incorporated into a recipe.  I have found that if I am going to add sugar or other dry powders to the whipped, raw, reconstituted eggwhite, it is best to add it to the drp powdered eggwhite before adding water.  If they are in the recipe, confectioners sugar, Splenda, Stevia in the Raw, cream of tartar, salt, and baking soda are helpful in getting everything to get wet at the same time.  Cocoa and cinnamon are not.  You can try to add the powder(s) to your mixing bowl, and then add just a little bit of room-temperature water at a time, so that at first you make a sticky mess, to which you add a little more water to make a thick paste, to which you add a little more water to make a syrupy slush, to which you add the rest of the water called for by the recipe.  This process does 2 things:  (1) It slows down the rate of wetting the powder so that the portion of the powder that hydrates first can help wet out the rest of hte powder, and (2) it tends to eliminate the stubborn little dry-center balls that form when one splashes all of the water in at once.  After you have all of the powder and all of the water looking like it is dissolved and well mixed, I suggest that you let the mixture rest for 5 minutes to continue doing the wet-out at the molecular level.  Then you can whip the mixture quite effectively.  By the way, I have found absolutely no advantage to hand whisking this reconstituted powder; a wire whisk attachment on a KitchenAid stand mixer is a welcome relief after nursing the powder into its reconstituted form.  I gather that the previous answers are aiming at fried eggwhites or some other dietetic result.  My cooking has been toward making meringues, terrines, mousses, lemon curds, isles flotant, carrot cake, and other things where the loft of the eggwhites -- and the absence of ""protein flavor"" -- are extremely important.  For such recipes, I have found the powdered eggwhites a nuissance, but generally superior to the eggwhites from the lowest priced whole eggs in the grocery store dairy counter.  Caveat:  I am not a chef nor an institute-trained cook, just a chemist who cooks for my family and friends.  Bon chance!

319,Is this very spicy?  I'm new to Indian food but it looks delicious.,"No, it is not particularly spicy but it has a full flavor.  Think a mild chile con carne.

Sometimes if you write the seller they will tell you if this is a mistake or the correct price. They're usually very helpful. Some sellers are trying to make a living and others are out to make a buck...just need to weed out the ones you don't wish to deal with."

Are the drops clear or colored?,"It depends on which one you get, some are clear (like grape and berry) and some have coloring (like toffee).  I have not tried all of the flavors but even the toffee, which is the color of coffee is still clear v. murky.  The lemon is also clear. You only need a few drops, this is a very concentrated product that goes a long way."

As soon as I receive any of Bob's Red Mill Products, I keep one in the frig. and the rest go into the freezer. They keep for a long time in the freezer & I use one at a time and that one is put into the refrigerator. Hope this helps...great products"

332,How best to prepare this? Are directions accurate? Mix in peas/carrots/mushrooms?,"I put 2 cups of the blend and 5 cups of water in my rice cooker and it comes out perfectly. So, yes the directions are accurate.  I use the salt but not the butter.  Then I use the blend for all sorts of dishes.  It's a nice change from my usual Texmati."

I haven't even opened it yet because it is based on Chia Rice and Peas and I am prone to IBS (I'm wary of any product that is lentil based).  I usually get the regular Spiru-tein high protein sans the peas, and I loved it.  Anyway, according to the label on this can, even though Carbs is at 19g. under sugar it is 0.  Mixed with milk it goes up to 11g of sugar.  I cannot vouch for its validity, that is just what the label states.  But, all in all Spiru-Tein is a wonderful product and a life saver on a busy day.  I am mostly concerned with the vitamin and protein rating.  Mostly, the protein rating!

336,"I used to drink Roma Kaffree that I purchased many times on Amazon, 3 for 21.99. Now the price is more than doubled. Is cafix close to Roma?",I actually like Cafix better than  Roma -I use a rounded teaspoon with 7 drops of stevia/ 10 Oz cup along with 1/2 and 1/2 to make it more like coffee.  Also a bit of ground Cardamon and / or Cinnamon enhances the flavor for some people

341,"Does the Mini Triple come w/the tray dividers, to grow up to 2 different sprout types in each tray?",Yes they do! And that is why they are so versatile. So I bought three pack and I can grow 6 different sprout types at the same time! I love these!

343,"The last 2 times I ordered this, it was thin and had a metallic taste (awful).  Used to be very good.  Anybody had good experience lately?","I understand, I was introduced to this buy accident but I loved it so much I kept ordering it when I needed it. I had an order really @#$% up but they made good on it. Yes they made good with 3 times the amount of what with stuff I did not order!!It all comes down to if you are going to dilute or water down your product tell them!! Their is no doubt the new ordered stuff is just a watered down version of the original."
344,are the plastic jars BPA & phlalate free?  what is the recycle number on plastic jar?  Please answer thank you,"Per the Nutiva website:  Nutiva packages our oil in three types of materials: Glass jars, clear PET and white HDPE. We have found the white HDPE holds up better for shipping via UPS or USPS during the hot summer months.Also note Nutiva containers are made without BPA. Bisphenol A or BPA is used in some plastics and tin cans."
345,"Have these been tested for arsenic? Though we love these treats, we have stopped buying them because they contain brown rice sugar.",Fabulous... I just read up on the arsenic. So... All things in moderation and our kids could be ok with the lower consumption rate. But succors aren't ever really healthy anyway.

353,"When cake recipe calls for 1.5 cups sugar, how much of the Pure Stevia Extract does one use ... does the cake turn out with the lower Stevia bulk","You can find basic substitutions here: http://www.stevia.net/conversion.html  NO the cake will not turn out if you simply replace the sugar w/stevia.  Sugar is actually counted as a liquid in recipes, so the liquid must also be replaced.  For each cup of sugar use 3/4c. water or other liquid:  This is because a cup of sugar, once melted, is only @ 3/4 of a cup.   In this example,  you would use approximately 1 and 1/2 tsp. of stevia; and 3/4c. plus 2 Tbsp. of water as your sugar replacement.   This may still need to be altered slightly to suite personal preference for sweetness.

354,How much sodium?,"this company has a lot of products under their better than bouillon brand - you can get answers to your question from their website which is http://www.betterthanbouillon.com/default.aspx. As an example if you look at the vegetable base link you can see a 'Nutrition Facts' button to expand and show the required minimum data. One teaspoon = 680 mg sodium. The organic version is 700 mg.Their FAQ site is a good read: http://www.betterthanbouillon.com/faq.aspx because they address some of the issues I originally raised in my review. Please inform yourself about the specifics for MSG and maltodextrin. The company uses what is legal to use in identifying their products meeting USDA current approvals. There is no mention even in their 'Organic"" line of using NON GMO sources so for me the organic label is not actually viable or ethical to use even if it meets current federal guidelines. The company says it uses QAI, the USDA approved private company based in San Diego, to be able to claim the 'Organic' label.It is interesting to me to review the current USDA QAI definition of 'Organic' and why for me the addition of NON GMO is actually way more valid. The data below shows you can get an 'Organic' certification with no need to claim this also means NON GMO which it clearly does not.What is organic?An organic production system is managed in accordance with the Organic Foods Production Act and the National Organic Program to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.Source: USDA - National Organic Program 2001What does ""certified organic"" mean?""Certified organic"" means that a nonprofit, state or private certification organization, accredited by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), has verified that products labeled as ""organic"" meet strictly defined organic standards.I hope this information is useful even as I went way past just the Sodium question.

355,what are the ingredients?,"From the can:  ""Hand picked Chinese black teas are carefully blended with cinnamons, sweet cloves, orange peel, natural and artificial flavors""  Caffeine content:  40-60 milligrams."""
356,Is there anyone out there with extra cans of Neocate Infant that they are no longer using?,I had a lot of trouble finding this formula and having it shipped in a timely manner. I finally signed up on the neocate website. It was easy to do and they ship faster then the second party amazon shops. (I did order from amazon for several months) They also offer discounts when you buy in bulk or sign up for auto ship. They will ask the name and location of the doctor who recommended you use the formula but they do not contact them. After 13 months of using this formula and stage 2 products I can say that there site is the way to go. Hope this was helpful.
357,Does this come out like the distinctly green tea that sushi restaurants sell?,"I guess it depends on which sushi restaurant you're comparing it to and what kind of green tea you like. This is what is labeled as their ""traditional"" green tea, but it has a smoky flavor that I dislike in a Japanese green tea.  If you compare it to the Yamamotoyama Sushi Bar Style and Kirtland Signature Ito En Matcha Blend green teas, you'll smell and taste the difference."
358,Question:  How do you store the bags of cocoa?  Refrigerator?  Or on cabinet shelf?  Just wondered if extra fat left in product would require refrigeration. Thanks.,I've kept the bag on the pantry shelf and it has stored just fine for almost a year. No noticeable spoilage. But I'm no expert. (Never even considered the fridge as I keep all my dry baking goods in the pantry.)
359,Are these Haribo Rasberries or a different brand? Thanks.,"No they are not Haribo gummies,"
360,Is there MSG in Mrs. Dash?,No it says right on the label no MSG. Great spice I use it all the time and this size is great.
361,Are these Gluten & Wheat Free?,"Quote from the product description: ""We source ingredients which do not contain wheat, dairy and are not genetically engineered. 70% Organic ingredients; certified organic by QAI.""  I would guess you would be safe from Gluten with these, but if in doubt check with the manufacture directly as they would be the best source for that information."
362,WHAT IS A GOOD TEA FOR CALMING AND RELAXATION?,Davidson's Organic Hibiscus tea is fabulous and delicious - I especially love it iced! It does not contain any caffeine and is good for lowering your blood pressure. Perhaps it's just my metabolism but I can NOT drink it after about 1 pm or it will keep me up all night!  :)
363,what is the caffiene content?,No caffeine content  is listed on canister; I assume it must be an insignificant amount.
364,Is this the medium blend?,Yes and very smooth taste.  Most all my colleagues live it.
365,Does anyone know where they catch these sardines?,"They're labeled 'Product of Morocco' so that could be almost anywhere in the Mediterranean or Atlantic as far as the fishing banks...I've never questioned it before although recently given some articles I've been wondering about this & not just in regard to Roland products.. The prices on this & similar products in particular low - sodium with bones has become quite high to me  lately.. Indicating increasing scarcity. I would just suggest you call or email Roland...By the way also be advised that these 'sardines' are probably 'Herring sprats'.. There is no legal definition of 'sardines'.. When I ate them {called sardines} fresh ..grilled on the beach... years ago in Morocco, Portugal, Spain ,Italy & Brazil...they were considerably larger than those available in cans in the US...either now or even 50+ years ago when my folks would have them in the States...But they are tasty & I think still healthful. Good luck !

You can use this frosting for cup cakes....any type of cake or cookie, etc.  It's pretty thick, but can be thinned out with milk or cream.  The ony thing I didn't like about this frosting was the taste.  It has a salty after taste.  On taste alone, I cannot recommend this frosting."

378,Which prefecture in Japan is it grown in? Could an officer from Domatcha answer and verify this?,"This is a quote from Mother Nature Network ""Most of Japan's tea is grown far to the west of the Fuskushima area, where the 2011 nuclear disaster occurred. The tea producing region in Shizuoka Prefecture is the closest to the disaster area and it is also the only one affected by radiation. Most of the teas tested from the area showed trace amounts of radiation, but did not exceed the safety standards set by the government. A few have been found to contain radiation in excess of the standards, in the dry leaves only; the radiation levels fall far below the safety limits imposed by the government once the tea is steeped. We must also remember that the radiation limits set by the Japanese government are much more stringent than those of most other organizations, at 500 Becquerels (Bq) per kilogram, which is the same limit adopted by the European Union in 2011. In comparison, the government of the United States has a limit of 1200 Bq/kg, while the limit set by the WHO is 1000 Bq/kg. In other words, you don't need to worry about tea from Shizuoka Prefecture. Unless you consume your tea leaves directly, you have absolutely nothing to worry about and even if you do, the risk of exposure is minimal. Basically, if you steep your tea leaves, you can safely drink tea from Shizuoka prefecture. Obviously, this means matcha is an exception.""The last line makes me wonder exactly where the leaves are grown myself, although there's an individual that's pretty consistent in commenting to the comments of others in regards to Matcha products and they say: ""...just make sure you're not purchasing Matcha teas affected by the radiation fallout in Japan--which means avoiding ALL tea from the Shizuoka Prefecture region. The two brands that I know ARE safe are DoMatcha and Pure Matcha (there are others, but these are the two that I know of--not to mention they are high quality). They come from a region of Japan far away from ground zero. They are from Kagoshima, which is as far west from Fukushima as Denver is from New York. Also, the air currents go the opposite direction, which is why radiation has not been detected in those areas. Just thought you should know. :)"" In my own reading on Amazon I do know that MatchaDNA grows their tea from single origin, sustainable organic farms in China. A representative of the company commented to someone complaining that the tea color was brownish green. I know nothing about any of the teas so far other than what I've read.

401,Will the tablets last longer if I keep them in the fridge or will that destroy them?,"They're similar to regular pills, keep them in a dehumidified area below 75 degrees Fahrenheit"
402,"I'm curious, the description says it comes in 3 bags, but a small bag and a ziplock bag are pictured.  Several people say they got small bags, some say they got three bags, some say they got one bag.  How would I actually get it?  Also, do they really come in the ziplock bag pictured?  That's a bit odd that they wouldn't come in a factory sealed bag??

403,what are the ingredients?,"ERYTHRITOL IS THE PRIMARY INGREDIENT in this sweetener, not stevia. Erythritol is listed before the other ingredient, stevia rebaudiana, which means there's more erythritol than stevia in this sweetener.MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE [cleverly written] LABEL - it says ""we use only stevia extract with at least 95% pure glycosides"" - get that? That means that the stevia extract - the SECONDARY ingredient in this product - contains at least 95% steviol glycoside. IT DOES NOT MEAN that 95% is stevia and the rest is erythritol ... far from it. If the actual amounts of erythritol and stevia were openly disclosed on the label, they'd never sell much of it.

404,What's the expiration date of this issue?,"When I ordered, both shipments expiration were over 8 months from arrival. But I stopped giving my baby this formula because it is the worst of all the organic formulas. It has the highest sugar content and it has ingredients in it that can clog your baby's intestinal track."
405,size,"Received 12-15"" Sago Palm.  Beautiful!!!!!!!!!"
406,what is the expiration date?,Should come with 1+ year
407,Has anyone else noticed that the tins specifically have a later expiration date than the 1-lb or 2.2-lb bags? The tins I got were fresher by 3 months.,"I would avoid any coffee that has an expiration date.  ALWAYS buy your fresh roasted coffee beans with a 'Roasted on' date.  Freshly roasted coffee only has a shelf life of about 3 weeks.  The beans will off gas as well so the packaging needs to have a one way vent (allows off gasses to escape but prevents oxygen from entering).  If you are buying your coffee with an expiration date, you are buying old stale coffee, 100% guaranteed.  Do a little research."
408,This is more exspensive than store. Is it a convenience thing?,This is about the same price in our local grocery store. I hate going to the store so if it is about the same price I prefer to just order it online instead of going to the store.
409,are they salted?,No
410,How much sugar in one,"One bottle says ""sugars 17g""  That seems like a lot for such a small bottle.  I wonder if it is right.  This is not a sugary beverage by any means."
411,Is this a powder or pellet?  Plan to use it in  making pate de fruits. Will it dissolve or would the liquid form be better?,It's a pellet. But a very soft powder pressed as a pellet. It dissolved readily for me into water for calcium bath for spherification.
412,what is the number of calories per .5 oz cup,96 calories
413,How fresh are the apricots?,"Hard to tell how fresh they are since dried apricots are never the same as fresh apricots. However, I like them more than most dried apricots because of the soft center that adds more flavor than California dried apricots. They taste fresh...not stale...if that helps."
414,"Are these bars hard like brittle, or more like a granola bar with nuts?","These are hard like peanut brittle.  They are really good.  A buttery taste more than ""the other brand""."
415,"Does the Sea Salt flavor have MSG? I noticed from the comments that the BBQ flavor does. A lot of responses in such a short period of time. I'm sold, I have to try them now :) Thanks to everyone that answered so quickly.

The tree never recovered and they packed styrofoam into the soil during shipment that is impossible to clear out unless you repot the tree. I would order directly from the Bonsai Boy site and just pay for shipping."
417,"When the butter is delivered does anyone recommend to freeze it, if you don't use it right away?","Yes, that's what I do when I buy several blocks of butter. You'll want to keep it fresher by perhaps wrapping in foil, then put in a plastic bag and stored in the freezer till you use them, then take out one block at a time.  I use 1/2 of a block placed in a butter dish, each time."
418,how much sodium is in these products,"Pretty high, depending on the curry. From 480 mg to 700 mg. But they re wonderful and the sodium can be diluted with adding rice if that is needed. I love these and don't eat them very often."
419,Is this good as a dry rub for Pulled Pork in a slow cooker?,"I don't know, never used it in a slow cooker. I do use it for dry rub on chicken, beef, and pork in the smoker/BBQ/oven/pan fry and it is good. I'ts pretty salty so I use it sparingly. Or I use a little more and leave out the salt. They also have a Pappy's that has 50% less salt which is also good. I do like the flavor and would recommenced. Hope that helps. Thanks"
420,How do you ensure the chocolate won't melt in transit?  Can it be shipped with dry ice?,"Yes, we ship with frozen gel packs and thermal packing to warmer climates."
421,is this reisling ice wine,It is Reisling. My initial tasting at bottling  time impressed me. Cant wait til its really ready.
422,"Does anyone have the ingredient list for Tamicon Paste Tamarind Concentrate, please?","My container says "" tamarind extract only """
423,"I thought that ALL oats were gluten free, it is OATS NOT wheat, so how can there be a difference??? I also noticed that these are more EXPENSIVE TKS","They are similar but not identical.  For many people, the difference may be meaningless, but you won't know until you try.  GF generally means no gluten in the product AND no cross contamination during the growing and production processes.  While oats have no wheat gluten, as you correctly note, wheat glutens may cross contaminate the oats from neighboring fields or the use of the same machinery.  My wife and I eat only the Bob's oats, and I've eaten both versions from Bob's and had no reaction to the ones not noted as GF.  You may differ. Good luck!"

It has a high concentration of medium chain triglycerides consisting mostly of short chain fatty acids and is solid below and liquid above room temperature (melt point range 75-81 degrees Fahrenheit). 76 degrees Fahrenheit coconut oil is highly stable against oxidation and is frequently used in applications where long shelf life is desired. This oil is non-GMO, trans fat free and considered non-allergenic."

The label says to put 2 scoops in a glass of water, and assuming you have two scoops each day for breakfast, that comes to 14 Servings Per Container. BUT, Two Scoops Per Day??? Wow!!  I use ONE Level Scoop per day, and that is MORE than enough for Breakfast, and I'm a big, tall guy!  One scoop of this powder if very filling and satisfying, and I always feel great after having one scoop.  But I think that any more would be way too much. So, I'm going to say that One Jar has at least 28 Servings!!"

I only use Acqua Panna water bottled in Tuscany and I refrigerate the dough for days and even as long as a week before making bread or pizza. The results are an extraordinarily light crisp texture for the crust and light airy interior crumb. Hope this answer may help you in some way.   Jay F."

The label states ""Manufactured in a  facility that also uses tree nuts, soy, wheat and milk."

Flavors must be stored in some form of an alcoholic base. Many tinctures use just regular alcohol, this however creates a vile taste, completely defeating the purpose of putting it in anything. Thus, propylene glycol is used. You are correct, propylene glycol is used as a base for many scents and flavors, it's even used in hookah tobacco and electronic cigarettes. Propylene glycol, being an organic compound, is one of the healthiest and safest solvents there is. The flavorings sustained in the propylene glycol were extracted from natural sources, however if the bottle were to be pure flavoring, it would make it useless, because even a single drop of flavoring would be too intense in most cases. Just because they use something has many uses in human consumable products doesn't mean it's unsafe, quite the contrary actually.

483,is the item durable?,Does not need to be refridgerated until opened.
484,how many bottles in 1 order?,48 2-fl. oz. bottles.
485,Is this made from corn?,"It is not made from corn.  I use it without any gastrointestinal problems.  It is a sugar alcohol and many plants have naturally occurring sugar alcohols. Pears, sake, watermelon, grapes and wine have naturally occurring erythritol in them.  Some other sugar alcohols have gastrointestinal side effects, but erythritol is not usually one of them.  If you are on a low carb diet, honey has carbs, and although natural and a good sweetner, it is still a sugar."
486,Why did you stop  making this.   I use it in making my chocolate eclairs cakes.  please bring back,I use this frequently in my chocolate pies and I was really disappointed that Nestle is not making it any more.  It is so convenient.
487,"Do you get just one package for $10.95? If so, they are way too expensive.","No one loves shopping at Amazon more than I do, but these tortillas can be purchased for 1/3rd this price at Netrition.  If Amazon got close on the price, I'd buy them here for the convenience of using my Prime account."
488,is it caffeine free,"Yes, it is caffeine free. It is also Certified Organic and Kosher."
489,Where is the product origin?,China
490,How much sodium per bowl?,"Too much (760mg), but they still taste good (I often drain the noodles after cooking to cut down my sodium intake)."
491,how many are in the package?,"Hi, Judith!   Amazon asked me to respond to your question, so here goes......I only buy the smaller package (1.55 oz or 40g) of the ENER-G product because the smaller amount comes in a far better shipping container.  You get 50-52 GF communion wafers in a trifold cardboard package that has always kept the wafers from arriving smashed.  Friends in larger churches who buy the bigger tub always complain that so many of the fragile wafers break in shipping.  Mine never have.   I package them up myself by inserting each one into a little zip-lock-type bead bag (available at any craft store in various sizes).  Then I take them over to the church in a Rubbermaid container so that the people who set up the altar each week can reach in and add a few GF wafers to the general population of wafers without contaminating the GF ones.   As the other gluten-free person in my tiny church and I go up for communion, the Pastor simply hands each of us one of the little bags, we pop ours open and are all set without any fuss.   So....expect to find 50-52 wafers in the little package, which is a better deal than buying the big one when you count in all of the smashed wafers the larger tub seems to allow.  Another thing, by the by, this vendor has a completely GF free facility......a big deal, if you are a celiac like me.   Some of the other vendors offering  supposedly GF wafers actually make them in facilities that also make regular wheat-laden wafers.   Yikes!   Best wishes!

492,is this product gluten free?,Absolutely 100% Gluten free :)
493,"Several (6 to be exact)  recent reviews were one star for stale product, how can you assure you will be sending me totally fresh product ?","I am not the seller..... I am a buyer who reviewed the product. However, having had the product, I can tell you that these are NOT stale. They are RAW. Raw meaning not cooked. Not cooked meaning soft. The nuts you buy at a grocery store are roasted, which makes them crispier, harder, whatever word you'd like to use. These are RAW, as described in the product name and description.  But again, this is just a review, I am not the seller."
494,Is this tea tested for chromium levels?,"I recently had hair analysis done 3 weeks ago for toxic metals. My chromium level was normal. I have been taking tulsi now for close to a year. The hair analysis reflecks a 3 month level, so it should have registered if i was ingesting excessive amounts. I take a pot of tulsi daily."
495,"How does this compare to pearl barley in taste, texture and cooking time?","Taste: similar to pearl, but nuttier. Texture: remains slightly chewy even when fully cooked (and remains essentially whole in shape, unlike pearl which ""explodes"" in shape after cooking). Time: 50 minutes or more, depending on your preference (vs. 20 minutes or so for pearl)."
496,Can you explain the grade of beans ?  I have seen Grade A and Grade B.  Thanks !,"For most products, you would naturally prefer Grade A over Grade B - like meat or eggs, for instance.That's not the case with vanilla beans.  You should buy the proper grade for your use.  If you are going to cook with the beans, then opt for Grade A.  They have a moisture content around 30% and have plenty of caviar to scrape out.If you are going to make vanilla extract, use Grade B vanilla beans.  They are cured differently and have a moisture content of around 20%.  One misconception is when people use Grade A vanilla beans and then switch to Grade B they feel that the beans are dried out.  There is nothing wrong with them - they are drier by design.  Think grapes vs raisins.You can make vanilla extract with Grade A beans, but that does not mean that you will be making a better extract.Finally, there are beans known as splits.  Usually they split on the vine (sometimes during the curing process).  They are sought after by many commercial producers of vanilla extract because they have a higher vanillin content than whole extract grade vanilla beans.  They are not used beans.

497,If this has sugar in it; it is not just a reduction of pomegranates.  I don't like to be surprised with any added sugar.  Does this have sugar?,"Yes, there is sugar in it."
498,Is the Aretha pancake mix you sell for $19.45 a 3-pack of the 32oz box? The shipping weight says 2.2 lbs which only = 1 box so I'm confused.,"Jen - it is one box.  I think the 2.2 lbs refers to the rates for shipping.  The shipping charges are probably based on standard shipping for a package weighing 2.2 lbs or less.  But, it is one box and the pancakes are delicious!!!"
499,Soaking Is it necessary to soak these in order to eat them?,"It is not necessary, but it is a good idea, especially if you consume a lot of them. Almonds have phytic acid, a natural defense against being eaten which a lot of seeds and nuts, as well as some fruits and vegetables have, in them, which is an antinutrient, meaning it blocks the absorption of nutrients, and it actually depletes zinc. Soaking them helps to destroy some of the phytic acid so that you can get the full nutrition out of them and the other foods you eat."
500,Once they begin to get firm is there a quick way to soften them again?,I've never had a problem with them getting firm.  These are a little more solid than the Bassett brand but they're still pretty tender even after being in the TARDIS cookie jar for a few weeks.
501,"what would expiration date be?  1 year, 6 months, anyone know - there is no seller to ask.","The best by date is about a year from when I got mine, however if you keep it in the freezer it will last for a couple of years. You will have to let it come to room temp before you use it in recipes or you might have some abnormal results."
502,Are these candies individually wrapped in the one pound bags?,Yes they are individually wrapped.
503,is this decaf,"Hi Shannon, No, it is not decaf."
504,is this product kosher,"In the product description on the Amazon page, it says it's kosher."
505,What is this sweetened with?,"From the box, it says aspartame maltodextrin.I believe this is just like splenda."
506,"How much sodium is in this? you ask: 890 mg - or 37% of daily value based on 2,000 calorie diet",890mg per 1.5tsp
507,Need the actual sodium content per MG,"I just looked there is 5mg of sodium per tbsp.  I have to say that the flavor is very good, not your typical salt substitute taste.  It was kind of pricey with shipping, but I would buy it again."
508,Are the chips kosher?,"I believe so, they are delicious too"
509,Does this work with a Nespresso D-350 machine?,Don't waste your money in these. They didn't work at all.
510,Why did you change the formula? They're awful now.,"They were bought out by Nabisco who proceeded to ruin and cheapen the ingrediants. They at first tried under the Nabisco label and no one bought them so they went to the ""pretend"" box of Oval Farm  and still put the cheap crackers in them. I agree...;.they are aweful. Whole foods has a cracker that is a stoned wheat that you might like as a second best to the old stoned wheat thins. Nabisco needs to get their act together....I don't like even buying any Nabisco products lately because of the concern they probably are using cheap contents in other things as well :("
511,are you getting 20 bars?,Yes
512,"If Kirkland (Costco) stopped making the product in 2011, how old are these cans?","I do not know how old the can is, but my last one has ""Best by June 2017"" stamped on the bottom. I used one last week and it was fine."
513,"Will the San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend work in a Keurig Office B150?","I do not know that model of Keurig, but I can't imagine it wouldn't.  It has the same size top as a regular k cup, but the bottom is like a tea bag.  It fits into my Keurig, my daughter's, my son's and the one at work, and they are all differentKeurig models."
514,Will these work on the Starbuck's Verisimo machines??,"They worked fine the first couple of times, then each one started to collapse in the coffee maker and had to be put in the trash.  I drink 2 cups of coffee per day and in less than 2 weeks, they were all tossed."
515,what is the shelf life unopened,I have had some 3 months and it is still very good.
516,How much yeast is this??,5 grams
517,Odd question--what is the approximate volume? Want to know if it will fit into a 5.5qt container.,"Yes, it will fit."
518,Is this tea decaf?,"No, this tea has caffeine."
519,Where do they come from?,"They are from Italy, Spain, or Greece, as far as I know.  I am in Italy at the moment, and the Mediterranean pine nuts are definitely different from the China pine nuts, or Russian pine nuts or California pine nuts, or other pine nuts grown in the USA. These are softer, and have a buttery flavor, and different shape from other pine nuts.  Dr Fuhrman's pine nuts are just like the ones here in Italy.  I sincerely hope this helps you."
520,Nutritional content?,Has 70 cal tbl. Total fat 4.5 g. Total carbs is 9g
521,Does it say if the plastic jar is at least BPA free?,"NO, it does not say that"
522,what is the expiration date on these marshmallows?,I'm not  sure. I ordered them 10 days before my daughters wedding and they were all very soft so I know at least 10 days. :)
523,Are the cherries sweetened with high fructose corn syrup or with sugar?,Both corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup.
524,contain sugar?,No sugar added :)
525,Is the tea greenish or brown when brewed? I've read if it is brown then it is low quality and not giving the benefits it should.,"It's more of a gold with a greenish tinge.  I've had greenish green teas, too - but none that have tasted as good as Bigelow.  I hope this helps."
526,Are they from China?,"While I haven't purchased them yet, the writing and name on the package is Japanese, and the distribution company name is Japanese. So while they still ""MIGHT"" be from China, it's doubtful. The Chinese don't really make rolls like this, mostly Japanese and Koreans do. I lived over there a decade."
527,Do these fit the pixie machine?,I don't know as this purchase was a request for someone overseas. I do not have a Nespresso Machine. Too expensive for me.   I'm sorry I am no help.
528,"Where does the 77.5mg (per serving) of sodium come from, if the only listed ingredients are water and beans?","As far as I know, all food has sodium, especially veggies. Celery has a lot of sodium! Cook some Swiss chard and try eating it w/o anything added to it. Incredibly salty tasting, especially if you've been restricting your salt intake and are sensitive to the taste of salt!"
529,Would these be good for making peanut butter?,"Yes you can... if you roast them in your oven for 15 minutes, then let them cool slightly, you can either 1) put them in a ziplock bag and shake them to remove the skins 2) use a clean dish towel and rub them. the skins fall right off when they are roasted. They also make a better tasting peanut butter. As a side note they become a very smooth peanut butter as the oils in the nuts have been activated already so it doesn't take as long for them to blend, about 1/2 the time."
530,do you have a list of ingredients?,"Filtered water, organic soymilk, organic evaporated cane syrup, tricalcium phosphate, sea salt, vitamin A palmitate, vitamin D2."
531,"I have a bottle of aloe gloe white grape and it has a blob of something floating around in the bottle, is this suppose to be there?",Um I'm not sure. What color is this blob?
532,Also would these be good in smoothies?,Yes! They work well in just about anything you could think of!
533,is it in a glass or plastic bottle?,"Unfortunately, it is in a plastic bottle.  Wish it were in a dark glass bottle."
534,"I am giving the item as a Christmas gift - can I put the whole thing in the fridge or freezer, or do I need to open the package and remove items?",You can put the whole thing in
535,"Can I pour onto ice, then add a can of soda water, just to get a taste of cola, or do I need a Soda Stream type device? Nutritional Info?","You do not need a soda stream, soda water will work, that is how they make italian sodas is with just soda water and the syrup and this cola syrup is the best on the market as far as being like regular cola, don't want to mention brand names here but you know what I'm talking about. I hope this helps you."
536,Can this be used for coating baking pans? instead of Bakers Joy?,I use it on everything. Anywhere you would spray Pam or I guess Bakers Joy (never used it) you can and should use this. It is fabulous.. I spray it on the grill before putting burgers or steaks on and it works great.
537,How do you break the shell off?,I Pay an out of work squirrel minimum wage.
538,Anyone compare Reed's Orignial with Gin Gin's? Just curious. Thank you.,Personal opinion but the Gin Gin's are not as good as the Reed's Originals.
539,What is the nutritional information on this product?,There is no nutritional information on the bottle I have.  If you go to http://www.sunfood.com/catalog/product/gallery/id/1057/image/2616/ this will give you the nutritional info.
540,What is the serving size and how many mg of natural nitrates are in each serving?,I use a tablespoon a day in my smoothie is has immensely changed my blood test with better results!
541,ounces?,"Each individual packet will make one serving of tea. On average .10-.15oz per serving depending on how light or dense the tea mixture is. So if I had to give you an estimate, I would say that the entire kit is around 2.oz. total of loose tea."
542,I the Maple sleight a light roast or medium roast coffee?,"According to Brooklyn Bean Roastery's website, all their flavored coffees are light-roast.  see: http://www.brooklynbeans.com/bbr_roasts/flavored/"
543,Any diabetic needs the nutrition info before consuming- what is in these?,"1.4 oz per serving (11.4 servings in a pound) at 100 calories. There are 32g carbohydrates and 0g sugar.  DO NOT exceed this amount as it will have a laxative effect. Ingredients: Maltitol Syrup, Modified Food Starch, Sorbitol, Sucralose, Coconut Oil, Carnauba Wax, Natural Flavor, Caramel Color, Licorice Root Extract."
544,What size are the Sea Urchin Shells?,"The ones I received were about the size (circumference) of a golf ball, you may want to ask the seller though for sure."
545,what is its dimensions?,"12 & 1/3"" x 13"" x 3"""
546,Has the leaking issue been resolved?,There was no leaking for me when it arrived.
547,"What's the difference between these flavors as far as stronger bolder taste, flavor types etc.  JAVA / BREAKFAST BLEND / FRENCH ROAST?","French Roast: Boldest of the three, with a bit more acidity than I care for. It's a fairly standard French Roast, so neither as intense nor as bitter as Italian Roast or espresso. Needs 6 ounces or less of water brewed through it to hold its intensity of flavor, though. Java Love is your typical Colombian style coffee and Breakfast Blend is mainly an even weaker version of that mixed with another roast. Neither is strong enough to be called coffee, in my opinion, when using even 6 ounces of water brewed through a standard K-Cup brewer."
548,do these cups fit the keurig mini plus brewer?,Yes they do nicely.
549,is it a grinder,yes
550,Can you brew hot tea with it?,"Definitely, that is why I got it for."
551,is this product non-gmo? tn,I can't tell if it is or not from the label. You might try to write to the company at www.hoosierhillfarm.com to inquiry. Good Luck.
552,"If I placed an order now, what expiration date would there on this product?",I ordered about a month ago and mine expire in September of this year.
553,Is this the same as Clear Jel?,"Yes, another form of modified cornstarch."
554,"What is it a sadwhich spread, base or something similar to bullion.","Really kind of all of the above, but it's extremely salty (more so than Marmite, Vegemite, or Promite), so I'd go sparingly on toast or sandwiches.  It is essentially based on Bovril, a blend beef boullion and yeast extract, from the UK, which can't be sold here in the US due to BSE concerns.  This version, however, is thinner than Bovril.  I think they may have just snagged a food grade beef stock and thrown it into a small jar, labeled it and charged $10 for it.  Also, the nutritional label is clearly unrelated to the actual ingredients, because the only thing beyond ""zero"" is one gram of carbs and one gram of protein per serving.  No vitamin content (and real Bovril does contain fairly significant amounts of B vitamins), and it says zero sodium, which is WAY off.  This stuff is almost all sodium.  Mind you, I don't mind this Bovrite, it's rather tasty, but it isn't what they are marketing it as, which is the same formula as Bovril.  It's nice mixed with boiling water as a hot drink, and I just put the kettle on right now since you got me thinking about it.  I've also put it in soups and chili to give it a boost, since these extracts are glutamates, similar to MSG, and boost flavor.  But, I won't buy this again.  It's time for me to take a trip back to London anyway soon..

If you plan on storing it for months/years (disaster preparedness), this is probably your best bet for shelf stable peanut butter other than military rations. If this won't up, nothing else will since this comes packed into a vacuum sealed brick.Sorry I can't give you a factual answer, buy hopefully this gives you a better idea of the general condition the product arrives in."

563,has anyone use this cultured ghee in bulletproof coffee?,"I used it everyday in my coffee. its delicious. I use 1 Tbs grassed butter, 1 Tbs coconut oil and 1 Tbs of this amazing ghee. It's worth the money."
564,Has anyone used this to apply for eczema cure?,"I have used this on my daughter's legs.  Her eczema had gotten so bad that her doctor thought it was going to leave scars.   This honey works great!! Not one mark was left on her legs.  I applied it on her legs at night and wrapped them with bandages.  Her legs were completely healed within a week. . It is sticky and messy, and at times difficult to keep her from eating."
565,does passion fruit green has caffein?,Yes
566,I've read here that you don't need to use the MyKCup attachment for these. 1 more question: do I remove the plastic seal over the cup or leave it on?,Leave it on.
567,Is this oil made from gmo peanuts?,I'm not sure. The label does state that. It states that it's 100% pure peanut oil. You can contact the company at www.snappypopcorn.com to see what they have to say.
568,gluten free?,Yes
569,How do you store them?,In the bag in my pantry.
570,does the base rotate?,"It rotates just above the scroll part.  In other words, the cylinder that contains the pods rotates.  It's very functional as well as attractive."
571,How many calories?,190 per bottle.
572,Does this bread have a Russian name?,"The closest I can think of is ""rzhanoi"" :-).  I've made it several times in my bread machine, it always turns out great.  Husband approves! :-)"
573,I am confused by one reviewer's comment that this is a powder that must be mixed.  I've only ever had a product like peanut butter ...  which is it?,You are right. More like the consistency of thin peanut butter.  You need to stir it well before using.
574,Will this fit the Keurig 'mini k-10' ... I have the plastic ones which fit and works fine - just waiting for the inevitable failure of the hinge.,"Yes - If your Brew & Save Plastic ones fit, so will the metal version.  The K-10 Mini takes all standard size K-Cups but not the OEM Keurig Re-useable Insert."
575,How much needed per lb of whole wheat flour/rye flour?,5g improver to 264g total flours works well for 50% whole wheat/ 50% bread flour with wheat germ and oat bran added.
576,Is this bag full of powdered matcha? Can you make tea with it or is it just for smoothies?,"This bag contains roughly 10oz of powdered matcha (it takes up almost all of the bag's interior space, using the last bag I received as a point of reference).  I've spoken with people who do make tea out of it and enjoy it at least as much as other varieties of matcha, including ""ceremonial grade"" matcha, but I use it exclusively for smoothies, as my interest is less about the pomp and circumstance of tea ceremonies and more about the prospective health benefits."
577,how many do you get and are they assorted,"Well it's 24 pops per order. They work great as centerpieces and as favors. Depends how many guests you have. I ordered 2, and 48 pops was more than enough."
578,is this case of white cheddar cheese?,All small bags of white cheddar cheese popcorn of a very tasty quality.
579,Is it listed somewhere on the machine that it is commercial?,"I purchased two Keurig Commercial Office Pro model B155 for department conference rooms, in which 2-3 meetings are scheduled each week.  I have not received any negative feedback from colleagues and managers.  My manager and colleagues like it for portability (as opposed to the traditional commercial grade office coffee machine), usability and convenience.  Many colleagues prefer the taste and temperature of the coffee, hot chocolate, etc. over the traditional commercial coffee brewing system, about which I am in agreement.  There is a downside to the convenience it provides:  the generation of waste from single serve options and significant increase in the per cup price.  I found the Keurig website helpful for choosing a model designed for commercial use but purchased them on Amazon for competitive pricing.  You might want to do your comparison of models and features on the company website and purchase that model for competitive pricing.

Ray,"I emailed BulkSupplements, and received this answer: Hi, Around 95% of the world's raw nutritional raw materials are manufactured in Japan, China and Korea. Only one manufacturer of amino acids (our most common type of nutritional product) is located in the USA and they currently only manufacture 3 amino acids. All of the foreign manufacturers that we purchase our raw ingredients from have FDA Certification and receive periodic on-site inspections to assure the safety of their products and process controls. Many nutritional manufacturers located in the USA will print ""Made in the USA"" right on their labels, but what they don't tell you is that everything EXCEPT the actual nutritional raw materials are made in the USA. The principal ingredient you are taking as a nutritional supplement is manufactured in China, Japan, or Korea. Generally, the only thing made in the USA is the packaging, label and the empty capsule. Nutritional manufacturers are not required to disclose on their product labels where their nutritional raw materials are manufactured. So, what do you do? You have two choices. The easiest thing to do would be to tell yourself that you will never consume any nutritional product ever again. That's a pretty simple solution that would definitely work. But if you were really committed to your conviction never to consume any China manufactured product you would also have to vow never to take a prescription drug and never consume any processed foods for the rest of your life since virtually all pharmaceutical raw materials and food additives are manufactured in China as well. The facts are that there are many multibillion dollar pharmaceutical corporations here in the USA that almost exclusively use China manufactured raw materials in the production of their drugs. These multibillion dollar pharmaceutical corporations have a vested interest in assuring the purity and safety of their products and because the raw materials used to make those products come from China, they absolutely take every possible step necessary to assure the safety of their products and limit their liabilities. That is why many of the products that we carry are manufactured according to USP (United States Pharmacopoeia) standards as well as Japan and European manufacturing standards.

587,I love Lindt. Dove is ok. Hershey's and cheap chocolates are icky. Which do you think it is most like?,"To me it has great flavor but is in consistency more like a baking chocolate.

589,is this made in the usa?,"""A product of Cumberland packing corp, Brooklyn, NY Has dextrose """

593,could u tell me how much sugar is in the kind bars healthy grains,"Depends on what you consider 'sugar'.  The sugar listing on the label or how much will end up being turned to blood sugar.

Either way, I have found this EVOO to be very consistent in flavor, body, and color. I buy a gallon every 6 months and each time the oil is exactly the same."
599,"Is its all Organic ?  Some of the YS labels say ""Organic"" and some do not.  Please clarify!","This honey does not specifically say it is organic.  It does say "" harvested by healthy bees from eco friendly diverse regions"" and it is unfiltered, unprocessed and raw.   It is a wonderful honey.  Honestly, I am not sure you can get truly organic unless you go with the Canadian honey I bought before that was harvested way out in the wilds, away from farms."

I would never DREAM of spending $25.00 for one bag! They are very good, but I thought twice before spending $9!"
601,How sweet are these? This is a great price. We eat dates daily.,"They sweet enough for my taste , but not super (over) sweet. I am comparing to the ""Mariani"" dates from my local store. I order them few times and I like them more then from store."

Every year my grocer would order a case of it for our family.  I was just told today it was discontinued.........  :(
625,Where is your tea imported from?,I have no idea; I think this would be a question for the company itself to answer.
626,How long can the package be stored unopened without hurting the quality of the beans?,"YOU CAN STORE THEM IN YOUR SUGAR CANISTER FOR ALMOST FOREVER.  THEY WILL DRY OUT.  THEY FLAVOR YOUR SUGAR AND SCENT IT SO NICELY.   DON'T THROW THEM OUT WHEN YOU FINISH THE SUGAR, JUST ADD MORE SUGAR; I HAVE HAD THEM FOR YEARS.  YOU CAN STILL SCRAPE THEM FOR YOUR BAKING.   (separate them from the pack, of course, so they are surrounded by the sugar)."

It's awesome and a great about of chocolate, that's not boring, for the money. I hope this helps!  By the way, I'd buy the big container. It's a better value for the money and the shipping."
632,"how many grams of protein, carbohydrates and fat in each cookie?","Hi Terri - there are 6 grams of protein, 56 grams of carbs, and 6 grams of fat in choc chunk raisin, probably less fat in cookies without carob/choc., think figures are nearly the same in other cookie choices."

647,is this 100% coconut h20?,"They claim no additives but it is flash pasteurized.  Coconut water has some natural sugars.  All of us, but especially those with high blood pressure, need 4,700 Mgs of potassium a day, which is almost impossible to ingest in food form.  Vitacoco has 620 Mgs. In 11.1 fluid ounces for only 60 calories.  Four of these containers a day plus my food keeps my blood pressure stable and normal.  Even a single day off it and my BP  rises.  It also helps to take a liquid calcium/ magnesium supplement with it.  You can get an unpasteurized, frozen version called Nature Field.  I'll bet it is more expensive, and harder to store but better for being unpasteurized.  I take no medications.  Always find natural remedies.  Almost ninety.Love, researching natural remedies.

648,There are 2 sticks in each pack. How many packs come in a case?,30 two bar packages.
649,Is this a fresh yeast?,"No. Instant yeast is similar to active dry yeast, except for it is more ""alive"", which means you can mix it directly with dry ingredients instead of having to soak it in warm water before use. If you're substituting instant yeast in a recipe that calls for active dry yeast, reduce the amount by 25% and mix it directly with dry ingredients.Edited to add: I do highly recommend this yeast, though. I use it all the time and keep it in a Ziploc bag in the freezer between uses, and it stays active for 2 years, easily. Probably much longer than that."

I'm thinking of taking this with me when going camping.","I took the challenge and made a small amount of hot chocolate water.  As a diehard chocolate lover, it was actually pretty good if you are expecting a thin drink.  You might find it lacking while in the comforts of home, but while camping, it would probably be a treat.  Just my opinion.  Remember to mix the powder with a small amount of liquid before adding the rest of the liquid."
653,is this the same flavor gum that came in the 5 cent wax pack of baseball cards,I can't say for sure that it's the exact same flavor but it is close; it definitely has that old time taste of bubble gum from the past.

657,I'm on a clear liquid diet and will have to be a few more times in the future. Are the drops clear or colored?,"It depends on which one you get, some are clear (like grape and berry) and some have coloring (like toffee).  I have not tried all of the flavors but even the toffee, which is the color of coffee is still clear v. murky.  The lemon is also clear. You only need a few drops, this is a very concentrated product that goes a long way."
658,Is this toasted Kukicha or the un toasted kind?,Toasted.
659,"Do these ones have a smooth cream filling, or is it closer to a chunkier, jam-like filling?","it's sort of a thick jam. but it's smooth an nice. I mean it's not too think. just get them and try them, lol"

664,is this honey an approved umf rating??,"The Wedderspoon Honey is Not UMF tested/rated. I personally do not like Wedderspoon due to its raising price and inconsistent taste from dif batch. Not sure why this honey is popular on Amazon, maybe because wholefoods also carry it and most shopper do not know or have not tried other brands. I have ulcer and have been taking Manuka honey for 3 years, I have tried 80% of manuka honey on the market and have been to Aus/Nzw. If you are looking for UMF tested honey, I'd suggest Comvita or East Cape."

Those are the ingredients listed on the box, so no sugar, but unfortunately it has the same ""natural flavors"" that are in nearly everything.

Let's see.....the side of the container states that 1/3 of a cup is 230 calories after it's baked. So, with most Belgian Waffle makers using 1 cup per waffle (I've been watching review videos all morning of waffle makers, so I know most use 1 cup) I'm going to say that with only 1 waffle, you've got 690 calories after it's baked. :O  If 1/3 of a cup baked is 230 calories, multiply that by 3 to get a full cup, a full cup of prepared mix makes one waffle......you've got a 690 calorie waffle.

There really isn't a scent that it leaves behind, it just knocks odors out. I've used it in trash cans and diaper pales for years. I've used it in litter boxes and other areas where my cats would lay down regularly. It really breaks down the odor molecules.

In fact, Irish cows graze outdoors on grass for longer than almost every country in the world.

It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff.

Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.   Pectin (from Ancient Greek: πηκτικό;ς pēktikós, ""congealed, curdled""[1]) is a structural heteropolysaccharide contained in the primary cell walls of terrestrial plants. It was first isolated and described in 1825 by Henri Braconnot.[2] It is produced commercially as a white to light brown powder, mainly extracted from citrus fruits, and is used in food as a gelling agent particularly in jams and jellies. It is also used in fillings, medicines, sweets, as a stabilizer in fruit juices and milk drinks, and as a source of dietary fiber.

Coconut oil is a solid below 75 degrees or so and manna is too.  Nutiva brand needed to be stirred up once I received it and the flesh had a somewhat gritty texture. Artisana coconut butter was also solid but retained its combined texture very well and had less of a gritty texture at room temperature. They will both melt down on any foods you wish to put them on. I haven't tried Let's Do brand yet but out of those two I've had Artisana was a winner. Nutiva was too gritty for me. If you want a creamed coconut their coconut butter is probably your wish.

You can sprout them, dehydrate them, and then run them through a food processor to make flour. You can even use them to make raw foods this way."
788,"The description says four packages of 28oz each, but the label in the image shows 32oz each.  Which is correct?",I ordered this product in December 2013 and received 4-32 oz. packages.
789,"what is this arsenic in rice, that i have been reading about?  Is this stuff safe?","What is this in reference to, specifically in regard to this product? I have been using this product for DECADES and have not heard anything about this in regard to this product, ever."
790,"Does this have to be refrigerated before or after opening? If so, how is it shipped?",No it does not have to be stored in the fridge.  Treat it the same as you would for a can of Crisco.  It is really great shortening!!!!  Mine was shipped in a regular box -- with padding.  Enjoy!!
791,any preservatives,"No Preservatives, all natural, 90 times more Anti Oxidents than Pamgranite, 40 times more than Blueberries, very healthful, I buy it by the case..Taste wonderful"
792,1) Is the corn from GMO stock?  2) Is it made in a facility that also produces tree nuts or peanuts?,I read somewhere it was GMO although it does not say in the package. It is produced in a facility that produces tree nuts and peanuts.
793,There is no mention of salt in the listing yet customer reviews speak of salt in the product. Is there salt in this product?,There is NO salt in the product.
794,what is the expiration date? I just ordered three packs of 12. Natalie,Jan-15
795,where does it come from.  It does not say on can,"Hi, it is caught at least 100 miles off the coast of the north Atlantic is what I have found info on."
796,does this vanilla contain Coumadin?,"No, Suzanne, this vanilla does not contain coumarin and says so on the label.  I have used this exact brand from Mexico for years, as my aunt used to bring it back for me.  You can trust this seller and your chocolate baked goods will never taste better!!"
797,What is the expiration date of the package that you sell to the customer?,"I just got rid of the box but I do know, this was my 3rd box I have purchased and the expiration date is generous."
798,what are the dimensions of each ring?,About 5 inches
799,"We noticed on the front of the package ""Made in the USA from foreign and domestic products"" do you know what country or countries?","I don't know what countries, but I can tell you their new formula in vanilla has a very funky taste! I don't like it at all!"
800,How many loaves come with $14.23?,One loaf.  It is a murderous ripoff!!!
801,does this contain lead? since its from china?,Tests of Chinese teas have consistently shown them to be inferior to Japanese teas in terms of heavy metal (especially lead) contamination.  The fact that it is organic has absolutely nothing to do with lead content.
802,"Is this Actually Chocolate Syrup or is it ""Chocolate-Flavored""? Hersheys has NO chocolate in it. What is the ingredient list with this item? Thank You","Ingredients: Sugar, Water, Fructose, Cocoa, Natural Flavor, Unsweetend Chocolate, Potassium Sorbate (a preservative), Salt, Soy, Lecithin (an emulsifier).I've been buying this for years to use to make mochas at home and love it. It tastes good on bananas and ice cream too."
803,Is this 3 boxes with 18 cups in each or is this 3 boxes with 6 in each to make a total of 18??,"Ryan, k cups are usually about 50 cents each. This would mean this purchase should be 3 boxes of 18 each.   This is great tasting coffee."
804,Does this come with instructions for growing the different seeds? I've never grown sprouts before. Thanks!,Is really easy and almost the same for all kind of seeds: take about one spoon of any seed mixture (double if seeds are biger size) and soak them in wather overnight. Rinse them and put them in the sprouter (a jar or even the plastic box where you buy alfalfa sprouts in the market). water them at least twice a day for about a week. Do not put the sprouter in the sun. In the summer you can harvest your sprouts in a week or less. Enjoy it! :)
805,Does it contain alcohol?,"Yes it does - it is marked as 41% in the ingredient list.  I've never found vanilla extract that doesn't have alcohol.  When you make homemade vanilla extract, you make it with vanilla beans and alcohol."
806,Is this product gluten free?,"Yes, these ionic products are gluten free. Its the best way to take them as 99% is absorbed by the body as opposed to tablets that may only deliver a small portion of their nutrient value."
807,"The soy used is, surely non GMO?",Yes this is Non-gmohttp://m.vitacost.com/products/san-j-organic-reduced-sodium-gluten-free-tamari-soy-sauce-10-fl-oz-1
808,Does this flavor contain caffeine?,"NO, ONLY BLACK CHERRY AND GREEN THUNDER....."
809,Any tips on how I should store this after opening? Room temp? Fridge? Freezer?,"For me the freezer works great, and it will stay green and fresh ."
810,How about doing sugar free drink in slush maker,"Should work just fine. The sugar doesn't thicken it, just the freezing."
811,With shipping this can of coffee is $28.98. I used to buy it with my PRIME for around $14.99/ can Do you think ONE can is worth almost $30. shipped,"It depends, to me, how often you drink it and order it. I only drink one cup at a time, so while this price increase is pretty awful (come on Amazon...really????), I can afford it because it takes me a while to go through one can.  If I were a heavy coffee drinker, though, my answer would be a firm NO.  I'd start looking on ebay or other sources for your TH fix.  Just MHO."
812,how do you use it?,"Well, 1st of all, Rebecca, the K/S Roast Beef is in ""chunky"" form: easily adapted to all of the ways you're accustomed to using roast beef, i.e. -with mashed potatoes/gravy & green beans, for a nice dinner-plate; or as a component of your own homemade stew; or shredded, as taco-meat, etc.  It has little of its own flavor, so can be seasoned to suit your application.  I've found it to be a big convenience to be able to simply open a can & have a quick, adaptable beef source.  I recommend it without reservation, Bruce."
813,"Why is this showing a price of $10,000 ?","I have contacted both Amazon (three times) and also the seller regarding this. The seller claims that Amazon set the price at $10,000.00 when they temporarily ran out of the item. Amazon informs me that sellers normally set their own prices and that this price is an obvious error which will be taken care of (hasn't yet). As someone who shops on Amazon weekly and occasionally uses 1-click, I know for certain this is not how out of stock merchandise is normally listed or priced by Amazon or its sellers. Usually sellers use the inventory feature which notifies customers they're ""temporarily out of stock"", and they can even include the ""notify when available"" option. Since Amazon offers the 1-click purchase feature, pricing out of stock items in this way seems like questionable business practice. I advise shoppers to be extremely aware of the prices on items while shopping on Amazon. This is an item I've been wanting to try for a while. It was in my shopping cart when I noticed the price change a while back. I had planned to place an order once the price was corrected, but I have yet to receive a satisfactory resolution from Amazon or the seller. Amazon told me they've opened an investigation and will get back to me within 48 hours. That was a week ago. I can only conclude that Amazon is no more bothered by this than the seller is.

Show Less","Greetings;  These are not oiled or sugared.  They are dried and therefore not moist.  I add them to breads, muffins etc. Since we eschew sugar, we don't mind but for most, they would not be acceptable unless eaten mixed with raisins so the raisins can add some sweetness.  I also add them to some vegetable mixes which I steam.  They will absorb some water and become a little moist and softer.  Do hope I helped.  All best."
827,Why is the honey precessed? I understand that many of the important nutrients are removed or destroyed during the process.,"By going to www.TrueSourceHoney.com and clicking on the starburst at the top of the page, consumers can enter the UPC code on the back of their packaged honey to see if it is True Source Certified as much is adulterated in some way and China has been involved in this. Millions of pounds of illegally sourced honey may continue to enter the United States, despite continuing federal crack-down efforts. True Source CertificationTM helps ensure honey's safety and quality because it traces the source of that honey from hive to table. About one-third of honey sold in North America today is now True Source Certified. Many large grocery retailers and club stores only use certified honey for store brands, including Costco (Kirkland Signature) and Target (Market Pantry and Simply Balanced).  I was just thinking that the honey I most recently purchased seemed to have sold for too cheap so began investigating online today. I googled and got ""make sure you don't buy illegal honey from china"" There are many other articles out that may be of more use to the consumer.

828,will k cup pods work with this coffe maker?,"No, these are flat like tea bags. There is an eco option where you can use your own coffee, but it's a bit messy."
829,I love to make peanut butter cookies. 1 cup of sugar 1 cup of peanut butter and 1 egg. Bake 10 min. Is this cookie butter the same texture as peanut b,"It is not quite as smooth as peanut butter and much sweeter since it's made from ginger snap cookies. It would be fun to try the recipe and see if it works, but I would guess the recipe would need to be tweaked a little to compensate for the difference. Good luck!"
830,Does it shut off when done?,"When the rice is done, it stops cooking and goes into a low warm mode. I am not sure how it determines when to go into warm mode.  It might have some kind of detector for moisture levels. My wife has left rice sitting in the low warm mode for five or six hours without a problem.  There is no complete shutoff until you unplug it."
831,Is this one quart before or after freeze-drying?,Before. The berries with the packaging weigh 4.75 oz.
832,Where is it made from?,"The soursop is a fruit that looks like a thorny apple. It grows in equatorial climates with high humidity. The juice tastes like a mixture of pineapple, strawberry, and coconut. It's very refreshing."
833,"The ingredients lists includes ""natural vanilla flavor"".  Anyone know what it is made from?","I'm note sure what ""natural vanilla flavor"" is exactly but I have purchased this many times and simply love it!  Of the various flavors available, this is the best by far."
834,Which is it flour or meal? Because there IS a difference,I use them interchangeably in a recipe.
835,i buy this variety pack at LEAST once a week for my office. Recently the price went up...why? i'd like to also get assrt coffee w/out the flavors.,We sell our coffee directly to Amazon. Through economies of scale they are able to offer our coffee at competitive prices. Final pricing decisions are made by Amazon based on their numerous business considerations. We have not made any changes recent changes that would reflect on the price of our coffee.
836,serving size & number of calories ?,No idea on the calories. But it is 1 pound

839,Are Your seeds  raw or roasted? Thank you,raw... made for beautiful sprouting.
840,Is the corn starch made from non genetically modified organism corn?? That is a major concern!,"I don't know, but I don't believe so as it's not labeled ""non GMO verified.""  However, it is a good product so you have to decide for yourself if you want to use it.  Check with the cup4cup people directly, they have a website and you can email them questions.  Or, ask on their Facebook page."
841,what is the shelf life?,"The shelf life is 3 years. The can I purchased had a production date of Nov 11, 2012 and an expiration date of November 10, 2015."
842,What zones does this plant do well in.?,"I think at least 4 through 10 is a good estimate but I'm not 100% sure, they can be finicky to bloom though sometimes"
843,What is different about the cup?,I've noticed a bit of a difference in the materials and thickness but nothing that affects the performance of the brewing process.
844,are these Blueberries sweetened?,Nope they taste almost exactly like regular blueberries. They're great for baking.
845,is plastic jar bpa free?,"Connie, I can't find anything on the plastic jar that says ""BPH free."" You might call a local Trader Joe's and ask them."
846,is this the same as 'clear jel'?,"It's similar to clear jel, but not the same.  Clear jel, like many other thickeners, requires heat to make it thick.  Ultra gel will thicken without heat."
847,Hard to get cap off after brewing. Is there a simpler way?,"I use my fingernail.  My wife, however, pulls the green cup off first then empties the cup and pushes the cap off from the inside."
848,how long does shipping take?,1-2 days
849,How tall is the candy portion of the sucker?,"Leslie, the candy part is a good 3 inches."

I haven't opened my can yet, but when shaken they sound minced. The picture on the can shows minced.

Sorry I couldn't be of more help.SHERRCO PRODUCTS, Honeyville, Utah, 84314, (888)810-3212."
852,is this certified organic?,"It is not USDA certified.  However, there is a sticker said ""100% organic"" outside of the plastic bag.  Some farmers grow their produce in an organic way but do not bother to certify them so the price can be lower.  It depends on whether you want to trust the farmer or not.  If you live nearby the farm then you can visit the farm yourself to see how the nuts are being grown."
853,what are the exact ingredients?  any soy lecethin or dairy?,"Ingredients are, cocao beans, cocoa butter, raw cane sugar & vanilla beans. No soy, no GMO no artificial flavors, & no emulsifiers."

855,"What is the difference other than price, between this product and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil? And also smell, cooking, and taste wise?",I use this oil in making soap & body butter for the most part & have used it for cooking when I don't want the coconut flavor. Wonderful oil no taste no smell otherwise performed  just like any other brands I've used.
856,Is this 100% Vermont Maple syrup?,"My container states the following; Highland Sugarworks---certified organic--grade A---dark amber---pure maple syrup.

859,Is this coffee or cider?,"This one is definitely coffee. I just noticed the description says ""coffee or tea or cider"", so now I understand why you would ask. I'm not sure if it said the same when I ordered it, or maybe I didn't notice. I purchased this exact product here last year, and it was coffee. Actually, I know it would still be coffee because of the variety name ""Breakfast Blend"". There are no Kirkland tea or cider varieties called breakfast blend. Please note that Amazon is not the seller, it's sold by ""Nilmee"", and only fulfilled by Amazon. You might want to click on their storefront, contact them, and let them know that the description is confusing.

According to keystone, a can in good condition and stored properly has a shelf life of five years.On their stie, at the bottom of the left menu, you'll see 'expiration date and shelf life', which is a link that explains everything.Hoping that is more helpful than the other answers that were posted."

(A side note: I have yet to find any brand of sunflower seed butter that doesn't share equipment with soy or nuts. I also haven't found a sunflower seed provider that doesn't have a similar cross-contamination problem, so I can't even make my own sunflower butter. I have no good solution to this problem except hemp butter, which is $8/pound and tastes like grass. Not pot, just grass.

The adhesive supplied with the drawer is industrial adhesive that can only be removed by scraping it off with a putty knife when applied to a clean dry surface.  The only surface that this tape does not stick too would be particle board.  Could you please try the following: 1. make sure the surface is clean and dry.  2.  Confirm the side rails and drawers fit underneath the cabinet, and the side rails will rest flat against the bottom of the cabinet.  3.

Show Less","Although I don't have the pot at my current location to check it for sure, I believe 36 ounces would be the total as they consider a ""cup"" to be 6 ozs.   When I make two twelve ounce cups with the pour over method that brings the level exactly to the 4 cup level, which from memory is about the half way point, so you should be able to get at least 36 oz if not a little  more with a full pot.  I can verify for you early next week if you would like to know the exact capacity.  It's a handy little carafe for making just a couple large mugs of coffee at a time, and versatile enough to use either the #4 Melitta or #2 Hario cones on top.

894,"If I use this in place of buillion granules in a recipe, how much would I use say for 1 TBS of granules?","Always go by taste.   If a recipe calls for 1 TBS of granules, start with 1-2 tsp of Better than Bouillion, dissolved in hot liquid and go up from there.  Again, go by your own taste.   After awhile it'll be second nature."
895,How much do I add if I want 4 cups of buttermilk?,"It depends on how thick or thin you like your buttermilk.  An average conversion is 1/4 cup powder to one cup water.  Keep in mind that if you add 1 cup of powder and four cups of water, you will have more than four cups total. If it were me, I would add 3.5 cups of water and thin it a little if necessary. Hope that helps."

I hope this helps you."

What state is the company from?,"According to their website the majority of their products are US based, but they do get some from Canada and South America.

But there is nothing in the listing or the label to indicate that it is organic. And a search on Bob's Red Mill site brings up 3 pages of organic items but not this popcorn.

I've tried several recipes, and the one that tasted best was a variation of the recipe on the package. The recipe calls for first combining 1/2 c. sugar, 1 c. water, and the spice bag in a saucepan. You bring that to a boil for about 10 minutes until you have a thick syrup. I didn't like the results, so I've experimented. My favorite recipe adds an extra 1/2 c. sugar and a c. of apple juice. Then I boiled the sugar, water, spice bag, and apple juice at a rapid boil until half the mixture was gone. I then reduced the temperature to a simmer and added the wine. I let that simmer for half an hour. You never let it boil once you've added the wine. The result was delicious and tasted just like the gluhwein I had in Germany.

921,Does it have caffeine in it?,"from mfg -  The tea's main ingredient is mulberry, but green tea is listed second to the last ingredient.  There is a minimum amount of green tea for flavoring therefore the tea cannot be considered caffeine free, but it only contains a pinch.  The amount cannot be revealed due to the formula being proprietary.  It is very different than taking a cup of 100% green tea.  Green tea contains naturally derived caffeine. (so no idea how much)"

The Bigelows don't respond on their website, twitter,facebook, etc","Unfortunately, I don't know the specific antioxidant content. However, here's a bit of info from WebMD: Several teas (including green tea) come from the plant Camellia sinensis. Green tea leaves are not fermented like many teas; they are withered and steamed. Teas from the Camellia sinensis  are rich in polyphenols. Whether it's green or black, tea has about eight to 10 times the polyphenols found in fruits and vegetables. Green tea is a great detoxifier. There is no doubt about that."
926,does this have a kosher certification?,"Just checked the bottle-no, no kosher certification.   Try The Itty Bitty Spice Co., from Vermont.   I'm not kidding - I light'Saltar from them and it was certified by established.  I know they have a large variety of spices that are Mediteranian based.Good luck"

937,How tall are these bottles?,"They are smaller than the minis you would get at the liquor store. Picture each candy as being about the size of a single ""fun size"" snickers or twix bar. But if you ask me... these are more fun."
938,How can you CALL this Buckwheat which is NOT wheat at all but your main ingredient is WHEAT?,"Most soba in Japan is a combination of wheat and buckwheat. Pure buckwheat soba is referred to as jyuwari. So labeling soba buckwheat isn't intended to be misleading, it's just what they call it. If you want pure buckwheat, look for jyuwari or towari."

I already use a konjac sponge to exfoliate my skin, then apply the clay (mixed with a few add-ins). I keep the clay on no more than five minutes, rinse, then moisturize. I did this for seven nights in a row, and WOW. What I looked like the Monday before I started this is pretty damn yucky compared to what I look like by the next Monday morning.

958,do they use any sulfites in the process,Sulfites are not mentioned on the label and considering it's acidity I would find it hard to believe sulfites would be added. I'm not aware of sulfites in vinegar. It holds its own preservation via acid content.

963,Is this a fine powder?  Or the parts of the hemp that don't break down so well?  Does it blend completely into smoothies?,"I wish it did blend and/or dissolve.  Really it just mixes and needs to be drank rather quickly or it settles out.  But the positives of this product greatly outweigh the annoyance.  Oh and it's a VERY fine dust like powder.  My wife uses it in a blender with a banana and almond milk.  Not too bad.  If you can tolerate sweeter more robust drinks then it might prove almost invisible to your taste buds since it has quite an inert earthy overall flavor. But if you need a wide variety of amino acids that are readily absorbed buy the intestines and easily processed by the liver this is perhaps the second best of anything currently available.  The first being Chorella but it has some nasty stomach issues for some.  Honestly, with my wife's limited liver function, this has been a god send especially when her appetite is so low and her stomach is swollen from ascites.  One drink with a heaping tablespoon of hemp powder and she has a decent minimum protein/amino acids for a day.  Add that to even modest meals and a person will do quite well.  I hope that helps. Oh and BTW it's made primarily from the seeds.

TIA!,"I don't know what more expensive flakes you are talking about, but this shredded coconut doesn't seem to have much flavor and the coconut shreds are tiny and quite hard.

If you don't like the small ones, I'm not sure you'd like the larger one.  I like gummies, so I had no problem with them.I will say that the reality of the bear is so much more than its picture.  It is a very large, HEAVY piece.  It looks just like the little ones, only much larger.  I was impressed with the size and weight.  I got them as gag gifts, they worked well for that.

Show Less","We have tried several different brands of powdered milk recently to see which is the best for food storage. This is very good tasting milk according to my husband - very creamy. My ratio is different than the directions on the can as I did not want 3.5% milk fat. I mixed 1/3 c. powder with 2 c. water (or 2 1/2 level Tbsp per cup water). This probably made a very creamy 2% milk - more or less. The directions on the can call for 3 heaping Tbsp. to about 6 oz. water to make 6.75 oz. That's not even a full cup. The can will make 3.5 gallons (about 56 cups of milk) using my ratio above so that equals $4.95 per gallon or $4.70 with subscribe and save option. Not so bad considering. However, if you use the ratios on the can it can be very expensive.

""Our almonds are conventionally grown - conventionally grown products, use fertilizers and pesticides which allow for higher yield, out of season growth, greater resistance, and greater longevity. After growth, the almonds used in our natural almond flour are then steam pasteurized.

Jeff,I have the Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker and it uses the Senseo coffee pods or these. You have to put one in the bottom of the holder then flip the top closed and set the second on top of that. Works great for two of these pods. I wish I could attach a picture.

It's more to give you the nutrients you may be missing from not eating properly all the time.I hope this helps.

1135,does it tase disgusting,"I like it.  I drink the Glucose Control version, which has more protein and fewer carbs than the Original version.  It could use a little more chocolate, in my opinion, but otherwise it's like drinking a thick chocolate milk.  Much tastier than the whey protein drinks I've tried."
1136,How similar in flavor is this to matcha?  Similar or totally different?,"I don't know, I've never had Matcha.  What I can tell you is that the All Natural Organic Instant is very strong, almost bitter taste.  By the time that I add fruits and vegetables, and fruit juice to make my smoothie, the smoothie takes on less of the flavor of the green tea."

When I ordered multiple B150's from a distributor, I was sent K150's instead.  When I typed in the barcode to list them for sale on Amazon, the barcode came up as a B150 and since the same product page is used for multiple sellers, I could not customize it and change it to K150, so if you buy a B150 from me (BarginsForU), you will get a K150.  It is just a manufacture # instead of a retail model #."
1141,How/where can I buy a bottle of this stuff?,"Hello, currently Little Soya is not sold in a traditional glass bottle. We have only the fish-shaped packets like you see here on Amazon and we also sell to the food service industry in half gallon and 5 gallon size containers.  We are hoping to launch in a glass bottle size later this year! Thanks for your message."
1142,how many bottles come in this package?,I was ripped off by the seller and only received 1 bottle (but paid the price of 6) . BUYER BEWARE!!
1143,is the box equal to 1 cup cocoa powder,It's much more.  Prob about 3 cups.
1144,What is the shelf life after opening?,"Based on the way fish sauce was made, I doubt there is a shelf life"
1145,DO the seeds always have to be soaked?  I just toast them as I do with almonds etc,No. We keep them in our freezer and eat them as is out of freezer.  They're excellent tasting and as a food stuff.
1146,what is the correct ratio to use for curing london broil or do i only have to use this on ground meat. is the ratio 1/4 tsp > 1 LB ?,best advice i can provide: google: katz's corn beef or pastrami recipe. they provide excellent directions/instructions for curing your own meat whether it be corned beef or pastrami.
1147,"what is the calorie count, protein and fiber?","Calories = 200, Protein = 6, Fiber = 7.  If you have a chocolate craving, this will help you stay away from chocolate candy bars and etc...."
1148,"Is each package 80 ounces, making a pack of 4 320 ounces total? Thanks.","Yes, each bag is 80 oz (5#)."
1149,What does the use of this product help?,"this is a marvel of all Herbs it has great healing power of liver problem, can help in controlling Diabetes and liver related problem + other skin rash. bring more luster in your skin. you must try minimum three month to see the result. THIS HERB DO NOT CONTROL BUT CURE . in india it is being used for thousand of year and you will not find any kitchen without it."
1150,Alcohol content,There isn't any. It's like root beer except instead of made with sasparilla it is made with ginger. It is fantastic though. Goes really well with rum also
1151,Anybody know the shelf life of this product? Don't want to order four jars and have to eat them all before they spoil.,the expiration date said like a year but i kept mine in the fridge and they still molded in two or three months. but thats still a pretty long time to have to eat them.

1154,Can you order these without Black Tea and Lemon?  We have loved the variety pack except for that flavor - just threw it straight in the garbage.,"Send them to me! Black tea is my favorite one! Try mixing 4 parts (any flavor) and 1 part Black Tea. It probably won't change the taste too much, and you'll run out of Black Tea at the same time that you run out of the other flavors."
1155,"Hi, the image says 6 boxes. Above, it says there are 16 sachets in a box. I just want to be clear that if I order this, I will receive 6 boxes of 16.","Hi Liz,  Yes, you will receive 6 boxes, each containing 16 sachets of coffee. Be bless and enjoy."

Are these real reviews?,"Influenster did give us the product but they didn't force us to write a review. We were only asked to write one and the only thing we get in return is credit towards a badge. My review was real. The darn cookie just did not hold up well in my purse. Luckily, it was delicious (like every other belvita biscuit I've tried)."
1158,"The single bottles say ""new improved flavor"". Does this three pack have the new flavorings or is it a clearance of the less flavorful ones?","Not sure if the ones i purchased are the new ones. I did not really like them. I have to add too much for flavor.  Then it's too sweet if too much is added. Not worth the price. The bottles say ""New Bolder Flavors"" and came in the 3 pack. The Luscious Lemonade is the best, then the Tangy Tangerine. The raging Raspberry did not taste anything like Raspberry. Not balanced right and too expensive for how much I need to use, for me."

1160,How many bottles are in the variety pack?,12

1163,Is the can BPA free?,"I pulled out a can I had on hand and checked for a BPA-free claim. Couldn't find anything so I sent a question to Oceans Natural. This is their response: ""Thank you for contacting Ocean Naturals. We're thrilled that you like our tuna, and have been a fan since practically our beginning.As far as your BPA question:  Ocean Naturals products are not manufactured with packaging materials (cans or lids)  known to contain (BPA) Bisphenol A Diglycidyl Ether (BADGE), Bisphenol F, Diglycidyl Ether (BFDGE), or Novolac Glycidyl Ether (NOGE).

This is what our supplier's certification claims ""Made exclusively from a blend of the highest quality prime organic vanilla beans grown and sunshine cured. This ""made with organic"" vanilla powder features a classic rich and creamy vanilla flavor"". Hope this is useful. LipiX Team"
1169,How is the 'upgraded' version different from the original?,The upgraded version has the needle built in the K-cup adapter and the single cup coffee adapter snaps firmly so no more coffee grounds flowing out messing up the Keurig.
1170,from what state/country is the honey harvested?,"Ok I was reading through the responses to this question and to be honest the label identifies the office/ main farm to be in Illinois, USA but also identifies the Product as being from Brazil & Canada.... While I'm delighted to have some Raw Honey to keep me going I know that some Bee Farms slave their bees by moving them from one harvest season to another to keep production high... and never giving them time to rest. This in turn produces lesser quality products. Just like in any production with exhausted workers. I have not yet inquired about the care of the bees in this company but its on my list of things to know. There is a nice flavor to this honey but if you are looking for American honey... this is not the company for you. Sorry

1173,Will this product remove all the fizz from my carbonated water like Truvia does? I'm hoping not. (I use a sodastream to carbonate my own water.),"Wow - never heard of this problem!  We use liquid Stevia with our Sodastream fizzy water and it is fantastic.  We also add flavored Stevias like lemon or Valencia orange with a sprig of mint and a squeeze of fresh juice for a refreshing summer fizzy drink.  Also try flavored vinegars like raspberry balsamic+plain stevia and you would swear it is Dr. Pepper.  We have used ginger, coconut, vanilla and berry flavored vinegars, mixing with the various Stevias and Sodastream fizzy water and ALL of the combos are delicious.  Have fun!"
1174,"Can someone list what is added to the whole egg powder?  I need to see any kind of preservative added. I see one question below who stated they would add a picture, but I didn't see a picture","No preservatives, Just whole dried eggs is all."
1175,How many ounces is each bar?,"Each Amber Lyn Sugar Free Dark Chocolate bar is 34 g (~1.2 oz). Here's the nutrition info: each bar is 12 g fat (8g saturated fat), 25 mg sodium 19 g carbs (2 g fiber and 15 g maltilol, 0 g sugar), 2 g protein.These are simply the best sugar free chocolates I've ever tasted."
1176,What is the name of the sugar substitute used in this product?,There are no added sweetners. But it does have maltitol.
1177,irradiated,"So what if it was irradiated?  You do know that irradiating foods merely kill microbes and mold, but do not make items radioactive, right?"
1178,How long does it usually take for it to start repelling fleas?,"This did not work for either of my dogs. I still give it to them for general health, but it had zero effect on the fleas. I got nitenpyram and lufenorem capsules which are actually working to stem the flea population.  The dogs love the brewers yeast tablets and think they are treats, but I cannot recommend them at all for flea control."
1179,How much sugar does it have?,"I recently purchased Nature's Plus Spiru-tein Gold,  Banana Berry Blast.  I haven't even opened it yet because it is based on Chia Rice and Peas and I am prone to IBS (I'm wary of any product that is lentil based).  I usually get the regular Spiru-tein high protein sans the peas, and I loved it.  Anyway, according to the label on this can, even though Carbs is at 19g. under sugar it is 0.  Mixed with milk it goes up to 11g of sugar.  I cannot vouch for its validity, that is just what the label states.  But, all in all Spiru-Tein is a wonderful product and a life saver on a busy day.  I am mostly concerned with the vitamin and protein rating.  Mostly, the protein rating!

1181,How are the individual tea bags packaged?,"Tea bags come boxed \.  Each is a normal tea bag.  I usually put them in a tea tin.  A word of warning, do not store in a plastic container or in anything enameled.  The citrus oils in the tea bags will ruin them."

1184,How much sodium is in the Morton lite salt?,A 1/4 teaspoon is 290mg of sodium. Know that this salt has a taste that gets some getting used to. I never acquired a taste for it.

1187,Do they still contain aspartame?,the ones I purchased are now made with stevia
1188,"are these a chewy candy or a hard candy? I grew up with them, but just cant remember...","Hi Jo Anne;  the individually wrapped ones, once you get the first few chewy layers off, are hard. The smaller ones that come in boxes are chewy. Hope this helps!"
1189,"I purchased it and now I am concerned about the origin, Where is it manufactured? I just get the name of the distributor on the label, not the origin","I looked the item up on Amazon.  The page you bought it from says, ""Made in the USA"". It makes sense to me because we grow so much corn here at home.  I hope that allays your worries.  Mark"
1190,Is NESTLÉ Fat Free Hot Cocoa lactose free?,no - it has powered milk in it.
1191,how the bacteria in the kombucha tea does not die with the hot water?,"IT is marketing only (Kombucha part anyway) I brew Kombucha and even when you start...if the water is too hot (as in brewing temp) it will kill the culture. You have to cool your starting batch (to an optimal 75-80 degrees) before introducing the Kombucha culture or mother. I am sure the rest of the ingredients have antioxidant and other values so it is not all bad but Kombucha is a cold tea, room temp at best."
1192,does anyone know the name of the new postum and maker?,drink pero its much better that postum I did not care for the taste.
1193,"Am I doing something wrong, here? Every time I use these, very light colored coffee trickles out....",You have to have the Lavzza coffee brewer which is very expensive. I wasted my money buying these. All I got from my one cup brewer was light brown just like you. I wish they would state that and prevent us from wasting our money.
1194,Do you have FDA approval for this oil ?,I never heard of FDA approval for cooking oil. Try the G.R.A.S list.
1195,is this used as a yogurt starter,"No this is not for yogurt starter.  It is more like powdered milk or powdered buttermilk, to use in recipes to add the tart flavor of yogurt.  It will not culture your milk and make yogurt."
1196,What is exact list of ingredients of the truffle oil? Is there is a flavor added? Or only truffle shaves?,"Hi Julia, The ingredients on the label read; ""extra virgin olive oil, truffle and truffle flavor"".  There are truffle shavings in the oil. Nothing else.  The truffle flavor is fairly strong so they have somehow infused the oil.  I'd never had truffles before so it is an acquired taste.  I like to experiement. I think I liked the garlic oil the best.  I was very happy with this product."
1197,does it comes with a pump,"It doesn't, at least the ones I've received haven't had them."
1198,should I freeze Kerrygold butter?,"Refrigerate for daily use, freeze for future use.  I buy a few at a time and freeze the extra."

1202,I read that whole flax seed is hard to digest-hard for body to break down -just passes through --compared to milled -crushed seeds.??,To reeep the benefits for flax the seeds need to be milled/ground. You can use a coffee grinder.  They are great in smoothies and sprinkled on salads working the other nutrients for maximum absorption.

1207,Is it Halal gelatin that is used in the candy?,Yes it is!!
1208,Are these made in Germany or Turkey/Spain?,Says Turkey on the box
1209,Mine don't seem to be very dry. Anyone else have this problem?,"I guess they're not super dry, but seem to be dry enough to preserve them.  Drying further might deepen the color, which may not be as attractive, depending on what you're cooking.  The big question for me would be how do they taste?  Mine were pleasant, hot enough to burn awhile, but not hot enough to blow my face off.  I like them and think they're pretty,."

1215,Are the toddler meals containers microwave safe,Yes they are made for microwaving
1216,Can you use this in herbal tea to add a licorice flavor?,"It's very strong so if you do try it in tea, I would just add a small drop and see how it tastes.  It's also very expensive so I would suggest you try an Anise Extract for tea instead."
1217,How many calories per serving?,"Nutrition Facts on the package says 1/4 cup of the mix ""prepared"" is 190 calories.  This makes 3 pancakes.  The Total Carbohydrate 12g.

1221,What  is the shelf life of these rice cakes?,"I have had rice cakes stay fresh for 6 months but you have to keep them in a dry and cool place. However, the best people to answer this are the makers themselves. It has happened to me to receive a batch of rather stale ones, once, granted something unusual, and when I called them and they checked the dates, it was found that they were rather old and Lundberg replaced them immediately. But I had bought them directly from their site."
1222,I like wild rice but not brown. I find it too chewy and it tastes a little funny. I don't even like the stuff at Chipotle. Is this any better?,"Lundberg Wild Blend is a mix of 5 or so different rices, brown rice and wild rice are two of them.  I cook it in either vegetable or chicken broth, sometimes adding mushrooms and other spices.  It makes a delicious side dish."

1255,is this product aluminum free?,"I wrote Bob's Red Mill today (7 Oct. 2014) to ask why they no longer used the term ""Aluminum Free"" on their label. Here's the reply I received:Thank you for the inquiry. Bob's Red Mill packages an all natural baking soda mined from the earth. This is still the same product that we have always sold; naturally occurring pure bicarbonate of soda.Like most of our products that we sell, our baking soda is minimally processed (with water) and a product of nature, nothing added (including aluminum), nothing taken out. Recently we took the statement ""aluminum free"" off the label. The reason for taking ""aluminum free"" off the label is because we became aware that there can be naturally occurring trace elements of aluminum in our baking soda-likely due to the fact it comes out of the earth.The other reason for changing the label is that we are not aware of any company that adds aluminum to their baking soda these days. With this in mind, many customers and consumers then question who uses aluminum and confusion ensues. We felt omitting the term ""aluminum free"" will avoid any confusion or misleading claims with our customers. Please feel free to contact me if you have any more questions.

1256,is it smoked Bonito,"The package does not say anything about being ""smoked""  These are just just dried shaved fish flakes.  They use it for cooking, but I give it to my cats, they just love it.  They smell very fishy.  Most of the package are actual flakes, but at the bottom and mixed in are just very fine crushed ""mush"" not flakes at all.

1263,Amazon merged the complaints about a different Hershey's product (Special Dark) from eight years ago into the reviews for this product! Why?,That is a mistake.  Special Dark is a separate product with different taste altogether (I think they add sodium as well as a darker roast).  The natural unsweetened is the original cocoa that everyone likes.

""True"" cinnamon comes from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and is named either Cinnamomum zeylanicum or C. verum (""true""), and called Ceylon cinnamon. It was the primary cinnamon imported here until the past several decades, when for various reasons, it became quite expensive. Food processors made the switch to C. cassia to save money: same genus; same family; similar flavors; similar effects on blood glucose (for those using herbal medicines), but very different amounts of coumarins, which have blood-thinning properties. Ceylon cinnamon has tiny amounts, while cassia, depending on where it's grown, can have enough to require caution--check with your doctor. Since it's an agricultural product, there's just no way to know the courmarin content in any given amount.                                                                     For cooking, use Ceylon for more delicate, sweet foods, especially baking. For savory food, particularly Mexican, Indian, and other Asian cooking, use cassia. Saigon/Vietnamese cinnamon (cassia) seems to be the most robust-even aggressive, from some suppliers. It's often more expensive than other cassias. You'll find cassias labelled as Chinese cinnamon, Padang cinnamon/cassia, Burmese cinnamon, Java cinnamon, or other identifiers usually linking to where they've been grown. Everything other than Ceylon is cassia, the difference among them being where they were grown. Anyone can slap on a label saying Saigon cinnamon. Unless the Latin name is given, judge by your supplier's reputation and service.  While I order some herbs and spices online, from some marvelous companies, I mostly buy in bulk at my natural foods coop, and they buy from Frontier.

You just boil 3/4 to 1 cup of the dried berries in a quart of water until the liquid is reduced by half, strain it through a cheesecloth, add 1/2 to 1 cup of raw honey, sugar or pure maple syrup according to taste, and put it in a jar in the fridge.If that's too much work you can make an elixir by steeping about 3 oz of the berries in a pint of good brandy with about half a cup of raw honey (or more to taste) in a sealed jar in your cupboard for 6 weeks."
1292,Is this powder?  It says take 3 vcaps/day.,Supplement FactsServing Size: 1 Scoop (Approximately 4 Grams)Servings Per Container: Approximately 45.It says one scoop so sounds like a powder to me.
1293,Where is the Nagano White Miso Paste grown and made?  Thank you.,"The label reads product of japan, and imported by JFC international Los angles ca."
1294,"Once I open it, how long will they stay fresh? This is a good deal, but I'm only by myself..so it could take like a year to finish 5bls","Unroll bag and just cut one corner with scissors to form a mouth.  Pour about 1 pound at a time into an airtight container, leaving the rest in the bag.  Fold mouth part in, and duct tape shut.  That's how I've done it for the past 2 years.  Simple and efficient.  Also, from everything I know about coffee beans, refrigerator storage is not recommended as it dries out the bean."
1295,HiI was wondering if this milk needs to be refrigerated? Thanks!,No it does not. Only after opening.
1296,Is each tablet individually wrapped?,It is not in a tablet form. The individual packets contains approx. 8 gms of the Emergen-C juice powder.
1297,Will those almonds sprout?,Yes
1298,bit of honey,"They are completely different candies. The Bit-O-Honey is a chewy/nougaty type of candy. It rates good, but I prefer jellies and Chuckles are the best tasting jellies for me."
1299,Since these are STORED & SHIPPED from Amazon I want an Amazon answer; Are these in the OEM packaging or are you scooping out of a bulk barrel?,Not familiar with the term OEM...the chocolates are in the Lindt box pictured & are 60 individual pieces wrapped as exactly as they are when you purchase the 5 oz bags in the retail stores for around $4.00 each. The product is superior.. I tested!:)
1300,what are the ingredients of the multigrain pita chips?,"Enriched wheat floor,sunflower and canola oil,organic cane sugar,wheat gluten,sea salt,less than 2% of following...yeast,malted barley,flour,rosemary extract,ascorbic acid.."

1302,Some customers claim that this isn't a full five gallons; how many ounces do you guarantee?,"If you look at the side of the bottle there is marks of measurement. When full, it fills 20L. 20L = 5.28344 Gal."
1303,Was it Good? I mean The Small Bears are nasty,"I didn't taste the pineapple one, that was sent to my daughter's boyfriend.  He said he liked the flavor.  I did get my kids a cherry one and a blue raspberry one as a gag.  The bears are very dense and rubbery.  I was not kidding about a serrated edge, it's by far the best way to get some off successfully.  The cherry and blue raspberry bears had plenty of flavor, but what it comes down to is what you like.  If you don't like the small ones, I'm not sure you'd like the larger one.  I like gummies, so I had no problem with them.I will say that the reality of the bear is so much more than its picture.  It is a very large, HEAVY piece.  It looks just like the little ones, only much larger.  I was impressed with the size and weight.  I got them as gag gifts, they worked well for that.  If your intended recipient like gummies, they'll like the bears.

1304,is it 3 boxes of 16 tes bags?,"Yes, 48 bags in total"
1305,Does whole grain actually have more nuggets of the grain in the mix?,"I don't really know, but size of the grains in the box are comparable to the original formula, so I suspect the overall contents are about the same"
1306,is this the same taste as the kind you order at the chinese restaurant,"No, this is more like what you get in an Indian restaurant (Chai is the word indians use for tea). I've been drinking chai all my life but this brand is way too sweet for my tast."
1307,"Can I freeze them?  And is the body 3-4 inches long, or is that with the legs.  3-4 inches for the body sound pretty standard.","I would not order these again. I had these shipped to my mom. She told me at least 1 was rotten. She said the bodies were about 4"" long."

1309,How many Tablespoons or Cups are in 16 oz (1 lb) of sprinkles?,"It's not an apples to apples comparison since one is a measure of weight/mass and the other is volume. However, I weighed a 1/3 cup of sprinkles and it was 2.5 ounces. Hope that helps."
1310,how many tablespoons of cacao powder will provide 200 mg of flavanols?,"Need to query Earth Circle Organics on that. Consumerlab.com recently reported on cacao products & found cadmium, a toxic metal, contamination in many of them. So be careful. If you consume this daily you might want to get their report."
1311,we are used to the individual packets- how many mix-with-1-lb-meat meals does it make?,I guess around 15-16.  The bulk allows you to use more or less according to your taste.

1315,Are these kosher?,Yes

So good.,"Forrest, I'm retired Air Force, I got assigned to Holland in 1992 and was there till 1996.  While there I fell in Love with Douwe Egbert coffee.  I have been drinking it exclusively since 1992.  I've had a Coffee machine that was a drip/thru that I've used the Ground Coffee with and it does still taste good, but not what I wanted.  Then I bought a French Press and used it for the Ground Coffee, it gave the tasted I needed but was a chore.  Then I found a Senseo Coffee machine that uses DE pods.  Since 1996 when I got back to the States I've been thru 3 machines and by far it produces the best tasting Coffee that you could ever want.  Plus it is way cheaper than Starbucks.  These machines can use one Pod for the folks that like the taste but not the strong coffee and also can use 2 Pods for folks like me.  I found all 3 of these machines in Thrift Stores.  These are the only machines I will use and as long as I can afford the Pods (Inexpensive) and draw air.  Take my advice and I assure you that it will surpass your expectations.

1321,Is it normal for the plant to flower without leaves?  I received plant 3 weeks ago.  it has grown no leaves but now flowers are appearing.,The plants will form the flower buds before it grows leaves in the spring. There's nothing to worry about. This table will show you the relative growth cycle for your plant. http://blueberries.msu.edu/growing_blueberries/growth_stages_table
1322,"Since it is now July 2014, if I were to order right now, what is the expiration date of the packets?   I'd need them to last a few months.Please check",My wife has been eating them for a year with no effects. There is not an expiration date listed on the individual packages and we have moved them to a different container.  I would not be concerned about a few months whatsoever.
1323,what are all the flavors,"Kiwi-Strawberry, Pineapple-Coconut, Apple Crisp, Lemonade, Lemon-Lime, Peace-Nectarine, Mango-Orange, Lemonade-Strawberry, Ice-Tea-Lemonade, Blueberry-Pomegranate, Black Raspberry... Pretty sure that's the whole list for now :D Our top four favourites are the Pineapple-Coconut, Apple, Strawberry-Lemonade, and Kiwi-Strawberry!"
1324,what is the current expiration date?,We would not reorder again. Too many packets with an expiration date only 9 months down the road.
1325,Once opened must bottles be refrigerated?Or can they be safely put in a cabinet?,I don't refrigerate the bottles I have. I just keep them on my kitchen counter-top. They last a long time.
1326,Do these come in glass bottles?,These are plastic - easier to ship (and for me safer as UPS has occasionally dropped the box over my fence) and easier to unpack and handle. I have also bought in glass but after trying the plastic have continued with it. Hope this is useful.
1327,"One reviewer says he starts the ""must"" at about 75 degrees. What is the actual process and what is a must?","The must is the fruit, sugar, and any liquid that you will be fermenting your wine from. It should be adjusted to an expected alcohol level of 15% Your yeast will go into hibernation at about 14%. If you are working with a wine kit that tells you to make 6 gallons of wine, make 5 gallons. you will have to leave the wine in the carboys for 3-5 months. The higher alcohol content will slow the fermentation down towards the end. This will make a superior wine that will age well and keep well. The extra sugar will result in a small amount of residual sugar that will increase the flavor and complexity of the wine many times. Every one that has tried my wine tell me that it is far better than the 30-50 dollar a bottle wine they have tried. Most tell me that it is the best wine they have ever tried. I use Lalvin EC 1118 for all my fermentations, and have been very happy with it. I have never had a stuck fermentation and it always takes off promptly and does a good job. I have never had a bad batch of wine. Temperature is not critical, but 75 degrees is  optimal. Just sprinkle the yeast on top of the must and let it rest there for 15 minutes. then stir it into the must. It is important to have plenty of oxygen in the must the first 3 days. The yeast will not multiply its numbers without that. After 3 days you should restrict oxygen. If there is fruit or seeds or skins in your must, you should punch down the must every day. Do not let the must sit up out of the liquid or you run the risk of mold or bacteria invading your must. If you have any other questions feel free to ask.Larry

I can say from experience with the product that the aroma and flavor are all there and that this does not taste anything like the fake honey that one gets at fast food places or from generic grocery store brands.

They are both made with the best vanilla beans, the Madagascar bean but the double strength is modified for baking and freezing.

The DS is modified and cannot legally be called Pure but it is better for cooking because it won't evaporate and dissapate as much.. I have both but I almost always use the DS.

1342,how old does this plant have to be to produce fruit?,"It's not age that determines when it's ready to produce fruit, but the bulk of the cactus itself. Many growers say that the cacti must weight about 10lbs before you have any chance of it fruiting. The growth of the cactus varies by climate.

Normally, black tea has a moderate amount of caffeine, but not nearly as much as green tea. The tea in the chai is black tea. I copied this from the livestrong.com website (regarding black tea):""Exact caffeine content is difficult to pin down due to mediating factors such as brew time, infusion method, serving size and whether you drink the first or second infusion. However, in general, an 8-ounce serving of black tea brewed for three minutes contains roughly 30 to 80 milligrams of caffeine, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. In comparison, an 8-ounce serving of green tea brewed for three minutes contains about 35 to 60 milligrams of caffeine.""I assume that chai actually has less caffeine due to the addition of spices and orange peel, etc. The picture is a pretty good representation of what the tea looks like.

However, in general, an 8-ounce serving of black tea brewed for three minutes contains roughly 30 to 80 milligrams of caffeine, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. In comparison, an 8-ounce serving of green tea brewed for three minutes contains about 35 to 60 milligrams of caffeine.""I assume that chai actually has less caffeine due to the addition of spices and orange peel, etc. The picture is a pretty good representation of what the tea looks like.

1362,how do you seal EASYPACK pod makers,"You don't have to seal them...just place them in your Senseo coffeemaker, add the coffee (about 1 scoop), and fold the top over the coffee.

I get raw milk to use and let stand in glass Ball quart jars with cheesecloth or linen caps held on with rubber bands.  Mine set for @ 24 hours when kitchen cabinet is above 75 degree F, and up to 36 hours from 65 -75 degrees.  When the whey separates out (semi-milky liquid) to the bottom; which, can be stirred back into the kifer,  at this point I cut back the time by 2-4 hours.  To get a thicker cream I let set for 12 - 24 hours in cabinet (out-of-sunlight) to pour over frozen fruit with a drizzle of honey/maple syrup, it's better than ice cream! Use cream kefir for smoothies (milkshake style), scrambled eggs, oatmeal (hot) cereal etc..  Regular kefir I refrigerate  after separating out grains for drinking (w/honey or maple syrup), cold cereals, regular smoothies, cooking & baking (for baking increase by 25% for milk amount with organic whole wheat) but watch during cooking time and adjust baking times accordingly.

Thank you all for your help.,"Coconut cream is like the top half of a can of full-fat coconut milk.  It's thicker and has less water.  You can probably substitute it in some recipes, or in a pinch, you could thin it with a little water or coconut water as a substitute.  Where it's really useful is recipes that call for just that top half of a can of coconut milk.  You can also chill it and whip it for a great dairy-free whipped cream substitute."

1399,Do these mushrooms have any added sulfites or other preservatives?,The package did not say that anything was added to preserve them. I could not taste any preservatives. I use them as a tea.
1400,"why do they advertise 48 count, but there's really only 36 (3 boxes, 12 in each box)",Have to honestly say if that is true I never noticed. I did complain however that even though they were in date they were hard.

Products that are repacked in the US, such as spices and nuts, also declare the country of origin.It is actually a common practice among the industry that the country of origin isn't listed for two main reasons. Many herbs can grow in multiple countries so most companies do not limit their product to only one country so their supplies are not limited by natural disaster or some other issue. Along the same lines, the FDA has an odd regulation that requires that if a product is only sourced from one country, it must be listed on the label, but if it is sourced from multiple countries, we cannot list them on the label. So that is an example of the FDA puts all supplement companies (not only our company) between a rock and a hard place that we can only list the country if we limit our supplies.

First, I wash the rice in a strainer until the water runs as clear as possible. Otherwise, the rice powder from processing and packaging will make your rice overly sticky. Next, I soak the rice in my rice maker for 30 minutes, then I use the white rice setting and cook until done, then I leave the rice in the machine on the warm setting for 30 minutes. Afterwards, I season the rice with my rice-vinegar sushi seasoning mix and fan to cool. These basic steps will give great tasting sticky rice.

1404,"Hi, what is the expiration day on the latte box?",The several times I've purchased the coffee it has always had a 14 to 18 months left of shelf life.
1405,"Are these organically grown? I see Non-GMO on the back of the bag, but I don't see the words ""Organically Grown"" anywhere in the pictures.","These are not organic but, natural. This company offers both natural and organic products. The organically grown hemp hearts are in a different colored bag, green. On their website they explain they offer both to give people a choice. But, all the products are Non-GMO Project Verified. If you need more information the website is manitobaharvest.com...hope this helps."
1406,can you eat it like egg?,"It wouldn't scramble or fry like an egg (at least I don't think it would).  I mostly use it as an ingredient.  I do make a lot of French toast with it and scrambled tofu, but I mix it with something.  It is a great product and gives me that eggy taste that I have missed being vegan.  Having the recipe book has helped me a lot."
1407,What is shelf life once opened?,Mine lasts many months as there is so much salt in it.
1408,can I see the nutrition lable,"I no longer have the product, but I typed in a generic search for Trader Joe's Vanilla Meringues nutrition and several sites had details.

I am using it for cosmetics purposes for acne.,"They sell honeys that do not have the claimed activity certified independently (which allows in principle to sell blended or just flavored regular honeys for the price of active manuka honeys).Honeys with independently certified activity (Uniq Manuka Factor - UMF) are listed, for instance, at http://www.umf.org.nz/licensees ."

I will usually soak it for an hour or so before I'm ready to eat, then 5-10 minutes of boiling and it's done.  It does take a while to soften up without the soak but otherwise it has been great."

1434,Is this all you need - Do you need to buy a glass jar to store it in or can you use a large tea container?  Would plastic hurt?,"You need a container to ""brew"" the kombucha. I strongly recommend glass instead of plastic. I use a 2 gallon glass container with a spigot. I also recommend Grolsch-style beer bottles with pressure caps for the flavoring and secondary ferment. It helps with the carbonation. I hope this helps."
1435,Is there a list of minerals that this salt contains?,"Aloha, Edna! My guess is there are minerals in it, and the best source of that info would be to ask the Aztec Salt guys. They're VERY responsive."

There is never anything extra added. Think of apples going into a huge juicer.....1st pressing(extra virgin). Now take all the squished up stuff and run it through the juicer again, and that is your virgin. I hope that this helps clear it up."
1439,Where is this produced from? product in U.S.A?,"My container was shipped through spice land USA, NY. Doesn't say country of Origen, if different from USA. Sorry I couldn't help."
1440,How many ounces does the bottle contain?,I'm pretty sure its 32 oz.
1441,If I buy this for a Christmas gift will the Spawn plug be ok until spring to place in  wood? OR should I purchase closer to warmer weather? Wisconsin,"I am by no means an expert, but the research I have done says the two best seasons to inoculate the logs are: First early spring, second mid fall (when the leaves are turning).  This is mostly based off when you should attempt to harvest the logs and correlates to the sugar and nutrient level present in the harvested tree as it attempts to change between growth and dormancy.  In fall for example, the tree is sending resources from its limbs to its roots. When you cut it during that season, the nutrients are in the logs and in turn your mushrooms have more food to grow.  The fungus will winter over fine in nature and can also be kept in your freezer for several months.  So it may be possible to inoculate the log in winter.  But this is far from ideal.  Ideally, you want the organism to be established in the log before it goes dormant. And once dormant, not to disturb it until it thaws out.  If you attempt to do it during winter, the plugs will remain dormant until spring. But the organism may be damaged during the process or may not be strong enough to establish once spring arrives. Now, what you may be able to do is store them in your vegetable crisper until spring as they will keep for several months in the fridge or freezer.  Or you can inoculate the logs and keep them in a sheltered (semi warm) location such as you basement until spring when you can put them back out.

1442,Has anybody compared this to El Guapo? Which has more quinine?,I have not tried that one. I will have to buy a bottle to compare. Let me know what you think if you buy one.
1443,Can this bread be made without a bread machine?,"Yes. In fact don't limit yourself to bread with this flour.  It is great with baking cakes and things, (my opinion).  The recipes on the bag are great.  Follow them the first time and make adjustments after.  Also, I would suggest buying the 25# bag and placing it in a 5 gallon bucket with a lid.  I keep mine in the kitchen and it is incredibly convenient. I never run out and it is cheaper in the long run.  Good luck to you!"
1444,Is this Orange Blossom honey thin and runny or thick?,This honey is generally thick.  We hope this helps!

1446,how many packs in this combination,"3 packs, one of each flavor"
1447,$108.99 is for 12 bottles?,Looks that way.  Whole foods has it for 4.99 per bottle and if you buy 12 you get 10% discount so the case would cost you $54.

1449,"Is this a certified sustainable product? (Otherwise, this product endangers rain forests and orangutans.)","Hi M. Loughin,Our Red Palm Oil is RSPO certified.

Thank you for asking."
1451,Is your organic pumpkin powder  non GMO ? Brand I am asking about is Activz.,"This is directly from Activz website: All products in the Activz line are non-GMO. Forty percent of our line is certified USDA organic, and of the remaining 60%, many contain organic ingredients (listed on the front of select products and on nutrition/supplement facts panels). However, we source even our non-organic ingredients from suppliers that avoid using harmful pesticides."
1452,are they devained??,Mostly.  As I was taking the shell off some still had the vein or part of it.  I'd say about 1/3 of the 2 lb bag still had some or all of the vein.

1454,Can you send this with a personalized message/note?,"My husband sent these to me and he was able to add a personalized note. It's on a card in the box (mine fell out and I didn't see it at first), and it's also written on the packaging sheet."

1459,Does Gevalia sell just the froth packets?  I had one left that I used with Keurig's Cafe Mocha and it was delicious!  I just want the froth packets!,I don't think so. It's a packaged deal.
1460,do you really get 24 bags of this pop corn in the case of 4,"Yes! There are 4 large bags, each contains 6 small bags."
1461,is this for the tassimo machine,These are kcups for the keurig machines
1462,"The item title states, ""...3.75 oz. (8 pack)..."". So, for $5.99 + shipping, you are selling 8 boxes? And each box has 12 pieces",8 pieces.
1463,How do I mix it with cold milk?,"I generally mix my Best Raw Cacao in the blender with almond milk, protein powder, honey and a little vanilla, but it also blends well with regular milk and a little Stevia in my old Tupperware shaker bottle.  It is very powdery, so I try to drop it in the middle of the liquid to prevent it from sticking to the side of the container.  However, if that happens, just push it down with a spoon and reblend.  I hope this helps."
1464,"The description says if you use it in deserts you get that salty sweet taste that everyone loves.  If it has no salt, how is that possible?","There is no ""added"" sodium...but there are several different sodiums that are used in the curing of pork (pink salt, a.k.a. Prague powder, contains table salt and sodium nitrite, and is used in the curing of meats such as ham, bacon and sausage.  While these are typically washed off of the meat as part of the process, the salts have by that time seasoned the meat to a degree (different in each type of meat, and dependent on the size of the cured meat and the amount used).  Labeling law only requires that the label note all ingredients used in the manufacture of the product, in this case, the Hot Belly product itself...the bacon that it was made from was already cured, so as an ingredient it was simply listed as ""bacon"".I hope this answers your question, Ernestine...if not, please let me know and I'll try to do my best to help.  Happy cooking!!

1469,is this maggi made in china or switzerland,"The Maggi I received was made in China.  I've used Maggi all my life, and wasn't aware this was not made in Switzerland.  If you're concerned about the quality or any possible differences in taste, why not purchase a bottle and try it out?  It surely is worth a try, and the expense is not that great if it's not up to your standards.  I am happy with it, and my four daughters also love it."
1470,Is this coffee already ground?,No these are beans.
1471,what's the size of the bottle? The description says 8oz but on the picture it's 2oz.,The picture doesn't look the same as the bottle I received.  I received an 8 ounce bottle.

Barley just happens to be the February Geain of the Month!  But this isn't the processed barley found in local supermarkets.  This is a whole-grain barley which retains the bran and the germ.  It is incredibly healthy to eat, and delicious, too.  I use it in soups & stews.  You can also add it to salads.  It does require a longer cooking time (50-60 minutes) but it's worth the time.  I like mine cooked with a ""bite"" still left to it much like eating pasta ""al dente.""  Hope this helps, :)

1479,"What is the difference between this product and the one labeled ""granules?""","Hi---You have to be careful and know what you want to use it for.  If you plan on brewing it or otherwise using it in a conventional coffeemaker, make sure it says 'granules' or 'drip-grind' or something similar, indicating that it is uniformly ground-up like regular coffee would be.  I got a couple of bags from other companies, but they were little rough chunks of roasted chicory root, which are definitely difficult to grind-down.  So, it was smart of you to inquire.Good-luck,John"
1480,Is this produst just for frappes or can you make just regular coffee?,It is instant coffee! You can use a cup of hot water and just mix it with sugar. You can shake it in a shaker (a small amount of water and a normal portion of coffee/sugar) and make your frappe! You can do whatever with this thing :)
1481,Would this work for hard candy like a jolly rancher?,"Perfectly, just don't go too strong."
1482,"Are they just slightly spicy, or very hot to the point where they will almost take your breath away?","I normally like pretty spicy foods, but these were almost too hot."
1483,"It says gluten free in the description, but the ingredients list on this page says it has organic wheat. How can that be? Thanks","Ingredients on bottle:  Water, soybeans, salt, alcohol (to preserve freshness) NO GLUTEN....NO MSG"
1484,Is this price for one can? I can get a can for about $6.,Where?
1485,Is this powder or capsules?,Powder
1486,what's the serving size and how much protein is contained in each serving?,"Serving size is 28 Grams, protein content is 24 Grams."
1487,Is this the recent 2014 blend?,I bought from 2 different places. 1 sold me last years blend and it's a bit stale-tasting. The other was this year and I am enjoying it as much as I always do
1488,Is this dark or light rye flower,It is light flour.
1489,how many cans are in this,There are 6 containers in a case.
1490,Can i order only one box to try.How much per box?,"Hello, Yes you may order just one box, we added a listing for just one. 4.99 ea. Thank You."
1491,what do you mean by a 6 pack.  I see the same item with 16 bags for $3.99  why is this more expensive,Each pack of Yogi contains 16 tea bags. What I order is  6 of these packs in a box. So you would get 6*16 = 96 tea bags that is good for about month and half on average of 2 bags a day use. so I've setup subscribe and save for every 2 months.
1492,Every body keeps saying big jar. How many ozs. is the jar?,24oz
1493,I made chocolate dipped oreos and are cooling in the fridge... I want to individually wrap. Do I need to put them back in after or out in AC is ok?,"I only do strawberries with this product. After I take them out of fridge, the coating tends to soften again after an hour or so. Cant really advise you because strawberries contain so much internal moisture vs the hard oreo. Try taking out only 2-3 as a test and see what happens."
1494,How long will the jerky last?,"Well, I bought it in October of 2013 & the best before use date was September of 2014. Once the package is open, I do not know for sure. Hopefully that helps you."
1495,What are the recommended leavening agents for this?  Baking soda leaves a nasty aftertaste for biscuits. I want to like this flour.,"I was thinking that some gluten free recipes call for baking soda but not enough to cause an aftertaste.  Gluten free baking usually uses xantham gum if it's not already in the flour.  This is usually the ""magic"" ingredient that makes it feel like bread and not a brick.  Go to the bobsredmill website and check out their gluten free recipes using this particular flour and you might find some you like.  The only problem I have with this flour is it's bean based which to me makes it have an aftertase."
1496,is this NON-GMO product?,"I believe it is and read they are going to start labeling their products as such.  Suggest check out their blog, a lot of info on it."
1497,Is the chocolate in the these bars actually raw chocolate?,I have the chocolate coconut ones. Does not say raw. Says organic cocoa processed with alkali
1498,"Are these actually hard candy?.  I have found Gingins in a health food store but they are chewy, like a soft toffee and quite difficult to open.","Ginger comes ikn several forms.  I prefer the chewy ginger for digestion, Ginger Altoids for taste, and the hard candy least of all.  Not much ginger in the hard candy.  For severe digestive problems or nausea I take ginger capsules that I get from the health food store.  Hope4 this helps1  Bobbie Graham"
1499,How much sodium per serving and what is the serving size?,right from the package my good friend: sodium 150 mg (6% mdr) serving size 28 grams (about 11 chips)!!! In my opinion best tortilla chips on the market bar none; and healthiest as well!!! No I don't work for their company!!!
1500,How much sodium per serving and what is the serving size?,right from the package my good friend: sodium 150 mg (6% mdr) serving size 28 grams (about 11 chips)!!! In my opinion best tortilla chips on the market bar none; and healthiest as well!!! No I don't work for their company!!!

1503,Looking for good gumballs that do not get harder as you chew. Any suggestions?,We have bought the Dubble Bubble Gum for our gumball machine for the Grandkids and they love it. They have never complained that it gets hard and it sits in our machine for at least a year or more.
1504,Does the color of unbleached have an effect on baking time or cause burning on bottoms compared to using white parchment?,"I have not noticed an effect on baking times, and for me, it does not cause burning on the bottoms of my cookies, etc.  I like using this paper as it does not have chemicals in it, and the white parchment paper does; which can go into the product you are baking/cooking, etc."
1505,"Are these NO SALT or just LOW SALT?  What is the Sodium content of these sardines, please?","""No added salt"" is the most accurate answer. The ingredients listed are just sardines and water, and that is one reason I prefer this brand.  However, to me there is a mild saltiness in the taste of the sardines and the broth which is often part of the flavor of any seafood. The amount of sodium per can according to the label is 45 mg, or 2% of DV."

1507,Hi! what is the expiration date?,"The ones I purchased had an expiration date of 02.12.2014. Which is December 2, 2014 in european date code.  The first two digits is the day and the next 2 digits is the month followed by the year."

Show Less",I'm a subscribe and save buyer..I depend upon Tart Cherries for my arthritis - perhaps the quality has been affected by the terrible season they've had this year. The price has skyrocketed from $18 to $25 to now $35 - ouch!!http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/tart-cherry-crop-midwest-destroyed-weather-16768430#.UARZCEh2M5Y
1509,What other recipes do you use this for other than the nanaimo bars,"My mother used to make a hot recipe with Birds custard powder.  Dilute custard powder in whole milk, add sugar to taste, essence and stir on stove top until it thickens.  Let cool off then enjoy.  You could add your favorite berries on top or chocolate sprinkles.  You could also put it in ice trays and serve frozen.  I hope this helps.  Nanaimo bars (Canada's favorite confection) is wonderful too.  Try adding nuts, fruit pieces, raisins etc. to your recipes. To me, Bird's custard power makes the best crème burley."
1510,what are the ingredients of the multigrain pita chips?,"Enriched wheat floor,sunflower and canola oil,organic cane sugar,wheat gluten,sea salt,less than 2% of following...yeast,malted barley,flour,rosemary extract,ascorbic acid.."
1511,Do they have an expiration date?,"Yes, its stamp on each individual box. According to the lot I purchased, they are good for over a 1+ to 1.5+ years."

1513,My induction stovetop requires a minimum of  5 inches in base diameter for the magnetic sensors to work. What is the dimension of the base?,I don't think it's a full 5 inches more like 4 and 3/4.  It's a wonderful pan though. Makes great Greek coffee
1514,Does this take #6 filters?,yes
1515,are candies individually wrapped in 190 bag?,Absolutely!
1516,Country of origin is ?,My shipment says imported from Canada.
1517,How could I use this on my cloudy glass shower doors since it is in powder form?,"Wear gloves, please, when using this at an unknown concentration.  Acid is acid, and even lemon juice is not so kind to hands and it is only 5% citric acid.  Be careful.  You do not need to worry about it hurting the glass, however, if it is glass.  We store it (high concentration citric acid) in glass in the lab."
1518,"What's the best size portion pack for the eight quart Whirley-Pop, 4 or 6 ounce?",I have a Stir-crazy popper that is 6 quart and I use the 4 oz. pack and it is just right.  I would think the 6 oz. would be perfect for an 8 oz. popper.
1519,Can this machine connect to the stand?,yes you can. the bottom of the gumball machine has a screwing hole for a stand to be mounted. its bigger than a size of a quarter. hope this helps.
1520,"The price is good but... How necessary is it to rinse and ""toast"" this quinoa? And, if so, HOW do you do it??  Thanks!  :)",Rising is recommended. Place desired ammount of quinoa in a bowl and add cold water. Let it soak a moment then strain through a very fine strainer. The point of rising is to remove the saponins associated with bitter taste. Toasting is not required and will only affect taste. If you decide to toast place the desired amount in a pot at low heat and wait until quinoa begins to start popping. Add water and increase heat. Place a lid on pot and simmer. Amount of water depends on amount of quinoa. 1 cup quinoa and 2 cups water. Just double the water
1521,how long is the shelf life on this bread. is it as long as the rye?,The short answer is YES!
1522,what is a good thing to store the chamomile tea in after the bag is opened that is not the bag,"I would be very careful of storing tea in the fridge or freezer- tea absorbs the odors of the items surrounding it, which can be extremely unpleasant depending on what you had it sitting next to.   Also, if it absorbs any moisture, it may rot.The best way to store tea is in an airtight container in a dark, dry corner/nook/spot in your pantry or cupboard."
1523,Does this product come in Organic and GMO free?,"All ingredients in Dandy Blend are grown in Poland. The company in Poland that manufactures it for us is the largest manufacturer of grain-chicory beverages in the world, serving some 90 health food producers from some 70 countries. None of us would tolerate it if any of the ingredients were GMO. Beyond that, the only GMO ingredients allowed to be grown in the European Union countries, of which Poland is one, is one variety of corn and one variety of potatoes, nothing else. Poland has until now successfully fought the European Union to keep those out of Poland. Put ""GMO's in Europe"" into your browser and see for yourself. Bottom Line: there are no GMO beets, barley, or rye in Europe, much less in Dandy Blend, and they don't make GMO dandelion or chicory anywhere.

1526,approximately how many cups of chai-tea does it make?,"I didn't really measure as I went along. I use the large serving size of my Keurig for a 12 oz ""cup"" of water and add about 1/4 cup Chai to it.

1527,Is this cinnamon - organic ceylon cinnamon?,"According to their website www.simplyorganic.com, NO. Their powdered ""cinnamons"" are either Cinnamomum burmannii or Cinnamomum loureirii which are considered cassia, not Cinnamomum verum or ""Ceylon/True Cinnamon""."
1528,Does this have sugar added.  I am looking for almond butter without added sugar of any type.,Absolutely not. No sugar at all. In fact the almonds are organic and raw and uncooked. This is the best tasting almond butter I have ever had in my life. I buy 20 boxes at a time and I eat it every single day. It is very expensive but very delicious. The only downside is you have to stir it up because the oil comes to the top. It's nothing but organic raw uncooked almonds. Nothing else that's the only ingredient.
1529,Is there a specific food needed for this tree or does any bonsai food/fertilizer work??  Thanks :),The 0:10:10 By Ho Yoku Bonsai Care Products is good. It is nitrogen free and sold here at Amazon. Make sure to follow directions on the label.

But each tea bag is individually wrapped so I don't think any air could get to the bag to diminish the flavor.  I love this tea and drink it year round!"
1531,What is the date on these boxes?,"When I ordered they had a very good date, over a year or more. I have not ordered recently because I found them at Walmart."

1536,how do you clean it in order to use for cold foods,"Cleaning it is easy, the trick is to dry it off completely before using it again.What I usually do is, let it cool after heated use, wipe it with a wet cloth , the dirtier the wetter the cloth, i have not put them under running water but i guess it could be done if need be. Once clean, dry it with a cloth, let it dry over a cloth, or take it out under sun light to be sure it is dryed out completely. I usually wrapthem in paper towels to keep them dry before heating them again."
1537,can this be a substitue for potato flour,They are very different in regards to the baking world. I would not sub for potato flour. Hope this helps.
1538,My dh bought a bunch of this - how do we consume it??  I've added it to fruit smoothies.,I use 3 tsp in the morning with around 24 oz water and juice of 1 lemon.  The smoothies will cover the taste better than the lemon water but have way more calories.

1546,Has anyone ever compared the quality of coffee between the iperEspresso and Nespresso machines?,"I think both iperEspresso and Nespresso capsules are so far removed from freshly roasted freshly ground coffee beans, that they are pretty much the same, in terms of quality.

They are wonderful.  I have never had a problem with Lacey's or Amazon.  If you look on the bottom, there is freshness date.  If you have never had these before, they have a different taste because of the almond on the chocolate.  We will always buy these cookies.  They are hard to come by and pretty soon you will not be able to get them because of the warm weather.  I know as I tried, I was happy to be able to get them from Amazon."

All are satisfactory, but the imperial Matcha (ceremonial green tea) from Teavana is the smoothest and most elegant in flavor. I also get regular whole leaf Sencha green tea at my Teavana supplier and it is the Sencha not grown in the shade. Wikipedia has an extensive article on the varieties of Sencha.I hope this helps!

1582,can anyone tell me the ounces of this bottle of green tabasco?,"It's a small bottle; 5 fluid ounces!  Since the shipping weight is 13.6 ounces, the description is a bit misleading, isn't it?!  I expected a larger bottle when I ordered it."

I've been using unsulphured blackstrap molasses since March 2012 and it definitely helps with grey hair.  I noticed a change in my hair in about 3 months.  I used to highlight my hair because of the gray hair.  Now, I don't color or highlight my hair any more.  There is very LITTLE gray and what I do have, it doesn't bother me a bit.  I am not a fan of the Golden Barrel molasses.  It is not as thick."

The second batch I bought took over two weeks to arrive and the post mark on the package was from one of the countries on the Pacific rim. These were like rubber and didn't taste very good in addition to they were too hard to cook. I am not sure whether to trust the vender or not because if they send me more of the same as the second batch, I'll not buy from then again. Ed A"
1600,How many Tablespoons or Cups are in 16 oz (1 lb) of sprinkles?,"It's not an apples to apples comparison since one is a measure of weight/mass and the other is volume. However, I weighed a 1/3 cup of sprinkles and it was 2.5 ounces. Hope that helps."

Or in whatever sauce I am preparing to put in at the end of the cooking."

My problem is in recommending this.  I think I'll be telling others that it's still good 3 years later.  That's because I wasn't that impressed with the flavor and texture of this item.  I'm no longer using this although I have not yet maked the decision to just discard the remainder.  I'm now trying to use this up by popping the corn in this oil....

You have to add milk, eggs or egg alternate, oil and sugar to make waffles or pancakes.  The ingredients are per the Hodgson Mill website."

1634,recipe for new england clam chowder for 20 people,"Thomas, I'm going to forward this question to my son, he's the one who actually made the clam chowder"
1635,Has the bread been frozen or can you freeze it when you get it?,"I've seen it in the refrigerated section on one market, but on a rack at Trader Joes.  I double or triple bag my breads and always freeze them to extend their life.  Just be sure to keep as much air out of the bag as you can when wrapping it in the bags."
1636,It's certified organic. Is it certified non-GMO? That is very important to me,"As much as possible. This is from their website: ""I get questions regarding the GMO status of our products so I thought I would post here for our friends. All Great River Organic products are produced from non-gmo grains. It is true however that there is some cross pollination that occurs in nature especially in corn so while the planted seeds are non-gmo you can pick up traces of gmo in testing. Typically these are at a very very low percentage."""
1637,Can these be sprouted?,"people....please retrain from thinking that your ""guess"" constitutes an answer. It gets us no closer to the answer when you shoot off a 50 % yes/no reply...If you are absolutely compelled to write something, send your mom a note telling her that you love her...."

1642,"Tell me please,  each lollipop have individually wrapped?",I ordered the Christmas tree lollipops and yes they are individually wrapped.  They were packaged in a well padded box with Styrofoam insert to ensure they arrived undamaged and indeed they did.  I attached the lollipops to the outside of my office Christmas gifts for 24 co-workers. They were a great hit and good accent to each gift box! I would very much recommend this item!
1643,Let me confirm. Five bars @ 2.6 oz for a total product weight of 13 oz.?,"Yes, that is correct"
1644,"If I have this shipped, will the box show what is inside? It is for a Christmas gift.",When mine arrived it was wrapped in bubble wrap inside of a shipping box. The shipping box was not see-through.
1645,are these dates sulphured or unsulphured?,"Hi, they are unsulphured"
1646,Does  this product contain sugar ?,"There is no ADDED sugar. But, their is lactose in the dry whole milk (10g per 3 tablespoons)."
1647,How large are these stones?  Can they be used to make sole?,The size varies from small nickle size to about half a ping pong ball. I got 2 bags and they both had various sizes. Hope this helps.
1648,"The Product description reads (pack of 8)..  Is the order for 8 bottles, 46 ounces each bottle for $27.97 ?","Cherry juice, 46 oz. each bottle. A case of 8 bottles for $29.97."
1649,Which certifying body deemed your product Fair Trade? I didn't notice a Fair Trade logo. Thanks!,"I just found out that Dagoba is owned by Hershey, which is owned by Monsanto. So even if it is fair trade, it's not supporting real farmers - just big business. GRRRR - i wish they'd put that on their label too."
1650,Is this rice organic,No.  But it is short grain (not long) brown rice and has a delicious almost nutty flavor.
1651,"Is this 100% coconut water ?- (it doesn't seem to say that). If not 100%, exactly what are the ingredients and the %'s?","yes it is...100% coconut water, NOT from concentrate. The best tasting sweetest coconuts too (Thai)"
1652,Is this order 4 bags of cookies for the price or 4 individual sleeves of them in a bag as they always come.Want to make sure I read it right...,"It's four separate bags of cookies. That's assuming it's the choice that says pack of four 7.25 ounce bags. There are several choices - the first is for one bag, the second three bags and the third is a pack of four 7.25 ounce bags (total 29 ounces). that choice is currently 10.00 and It's the default choice when you click on the product page."
1653,How long after expiration can be used ?,Every thing I've ever read says do not use beyond the date. Even on gerbers website.
1654,Is the price per 4 pack?  What is the expiration date?,"Yes, the price is for the total of 4 cans, and I do not know the expiration date; yummy!"
1655,are there calories or carbs in this,I didn't know for sure. I don't have any on hand at this time but I googled it and found on this Health site 2 calories.  Sweeteners are artificial which some find questionable for human consumption. To each their own.  Hope this helps.    http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/van-houtte-kcup-raspberry-chocolate-truffle-coffee-81021837
1656,Have the sardines been tested for radiation?,"thank you for asking that question please review this letter by the company President and Founder Bill Carvalho has written an informative document which provides clear, concise information regarding radiation in Wild Planet products. Please see this link for a pdf of this documenthttp://www.wildplanetfoods.com/pdf/media/press/WildPlanetRadiationStatement7_16_12.pdf"
1657,I'm confused. Is this 4 packs of 32oz (for a total of 128oz) or is it 4 packs of 8oz(total=32oz)? because the 16 oz whet germ also says Pack of 4,It's total 128oz;) 4 bags of 32 oz
1658,"I was wondering has anyone used these for sprouting, I love soybean sprouts and this is a really good deal vs the specifically labeled ones that they say are the only ones you can use for sprouting.","I had several beans that had sprouted after being soaked for a while. I planted them in a pot and they grew to about 4 inches high, then just died. Don't know what the problem is or what I could have done differently. This was my first time so maybe they didn't get enough sunlight or something I could have added to the soil, I don't know but that's what happened to me. Hope this helps."
1659,Ok what else can this be used for other than Kimchee?,I mainly use it to spice up my vinegar which I use for pickling.  I luv this on pickled mangos
1660,Does anyone have any advice on how to prevent the roots from molding ? Mine start molding after about 6 - 7 days? Refrigeration? Ziplock?,I keep mine in the freezer and either grate them into food or just throw pieces into my smoothies
1661,"How much, exactly, is the number of pieces in the 5lb bag?",375 Pieces
1662,Trying to decipher exactly how this is packaged. do you get six boxes of 15 pieces each? How many actual pieces of candy do you get for the $8.99?,"Yes, 6 boxes of 15 each, 90 pieces total. Makes it nice to give as gifts and keeps you from eating them all at once. Each piece is also individually wrapped."
1663,How do these compare in taste/texture to store brands like dixie lilly or house autry?,They were horrible. .very grainy and tasteless.  Save your money
1664,How many carbs per packet?,If you really like Gatorade this is only place I have found to buy it and the packets have the same calories as a 20 oz bottle  which I believe is 120 Cal. You can buy a low calorie Gatorade in the stores premade in 20 oz bottles and they have only 80 calories.  Buy if you are looking for a low calorie energizer drink it is cheaper to go with the small bottles of MiO instead and you can sweeten it as much as you want and for a 16 oz glass it is close to zero calories.  And it is cheaper one little bottle makes as much as the bigger cans of powder Gatorade for about $2.39.
1665,What is the size of the candy part? not including the length of the stick? So I can buy stickers for them?,"I couldn't remember for sure so I went and looked them up on Oriental Trading's site....Here is what I found.....Includes a 2"" pop on a 4"" plastic stick. Blueberry flavor. Good luck Terra!"
1666,Do we have to make all of it at once or do we get a scoop thing?,4 scopes = 1 gallon scope is in the can
1667,Is potato GMO or Non-GMO?,Non
1668,how many grams are each bar ? Are they the full size bars. Thanks,They're the same size as the American bigkat version.
1669,Are these beans suitable for vegetarian?,"Since they are marked kosher, then yes, they are suitable for vegetarians; although not necessarily for vegans. And yes, this would include the sausage flavored one as well."
1670,how many net carbs?,"9 net carbs by my calculation -Honey, Almonds, Walnuts, Pecans, Banana Chips (bananas, coconut oil), Raisins, Sunflower Seeds, Coconut Oil, Pumpkin Seeds, Dried Cranberries (cranberries, apple juice concentrate, sunflower oil), Shredded Coconut, Flaxseed Meal, Natural Flavors, Spices, Raw Cacao Powder.Read more: Paleo People Banana & Nut Cluster Snacks by Paleo People - Buy Paleo People Banana & Nut Cluster Snacks 1 Trail Mix at vitamin shoppe Follow us: @VitaminShoppe on Twitter | THEVITAMINSHOPPE on Facebook"
1671,Whats the difference between Grade A and Grade B vanilla beans?,What I read was A is for cooking but B is great for making vanilla extract...you can use A beans but won't make it any better...A is plumper but B are good too
1672,Can I have the expiration date on the boxes if I were to order withing the next days?,"Sorry, can't answer your question, only because I bought cereal from another company, I don't sell the product.  I can say, however that I was dis-appointed with the product, from what I remember how it tasted years ago, til now.  If they sweetened the cereal like before, then I would rave."
1673,Can you boil the water and then put it on the oatmeal and let it sit for 5 minutes or do you have to heat the actual oatmeal.,"I also do not think you will get it cooked well enough just pouring boiling water on it and letting it sit.  It is not like Quaker Quick Oats.  It needs to cook.  Five minutes in simmering water is probably best, but I have also been satisfied with making 1-2 servings by adding the water to the oats in a fairly large bowl and heating it on HIGH for 4 minutes.  Use a LARGE bowl to assure it doesn't boil over.  Let it set a couple of minutes.  It doesn't need quite as much cooking as steel-cut oats, but pretty close, unless you like it a bit crunchy.  I do.  This is probably the best oatmeal I've ever had.  My second choice would be Trader Joe's ""Quick Cook Steel Cut Oats"".  Cook it roughly the same way.  You will like both.

1675,Does the packaging claim to be BPA free?,"No it does not, minimal packaging."
1676,"The ""Pack 1"", ""Pack 2"" sizes are a little confusing. To clarify, the price is for one cover right?",I got one cover in the package.
1677,Does this product list sucralose as and ingredient like most of the flavors which say no high fructose corn syrup or sweetened with pure cane sugar.,"Sugar is the first ingredient listed and water the second, but no sucralose. Used for nausea, and not to make a drink. A cap full when needed."
1678,Are these raw or roasted in shell? Thank you.,"As far as we know, they are raw and completely delicious!"
1679,Interesting you don't show the panel that lists the nutritional values!  Sodium must be off the dial!  Something to hide?,"230 mg Sodium for the Southbeach Chocolate Chunk Meal Bars, 3 gm trans fat, 3 gm sat fat, total carbs 24 gm, got the Nutrition Facts right here, let me know if you want any other info."
1680,How are 60 packets for 12$ a better deal than walmart's 30 packets for ~3.40$?,I would gladly pay $6 more to avoid anything to do with Walmart.
1681,How many bars in package?,No bars. It's granola.
1682,are these bars made with cooked or raw quinoa?,"The quinoa tasted crispy, maybe it is puffed.I have had sprouted quinoa, and this tasted lighter."
1683,Is this free of pesticides? I want to use it for cooking.,Avocados are #1 on the clean 15 (dirty dozen/clean 15 www.ewg.org)....very few if any chemicals applied to avocado trees....
1684,"Does it have an aftertaste, or change the taste of whatever it's used in? I mainly use sweeteners in coffee or tea.",I don't think it really has any aftertaste but I also think it's not super sweet either.
1685,"most hard tack recipes call for a tablespoon of flavoring. is this strong enough to do a batch, or would i have to use 3 bottles?","It depends on how big the batch of candy is that you are making. The recipe I used called for 2 1/2 cups of sugar. It made a cookie sheet's worth of candy. I used an entire ""sample"" bottle of this flavoring and I found it not enough. I hope that helps."
1686,So do the plants come separately packed from each other and the soil/moss?,"Yes the plants are separate from the moss.  The plants are moist and then youplant them in the moss when you receive them  Venus is doing very well, you losea few stems at first but now she is putting on some growth."
1687,How many generations can one replicate if the culture is kept well?,"According to several reliable sources, these heirloom cultured yogurts do not grow weaker with each batch. http://www.thekitchn.com/heirloom-yogurt-cultures-a-diy-musthave-192894"
1688,How many cotton candy cones can I expect to make with a 3.25 lb carton?,"We estimate 50 cones.   With low humidity, closer to 60."

1690,"is this powdwe, or paste? do I have to keep it refrigerated after opening?",Not a powder!  It is a thick liquid and must be refrigerated after opening.
1691,How is the taste of this formula? I am hesitant to buy and let it go to waste again because of the smell and the taste. Thanks!,Vanillia one taste is ok. Sweet and vanilla like. My son likes it. He did not like tropical flavor and unflavored...both are bleeee ( you have to mix it with some juice or soup) .
1692,Are these the type of mushrooms used in Hot and Sour soup ?,"Yes, you can use these for hot and sour soup if you can't get fresh ones but you also need shitakes. The soup takes both. These take a very long time to rehydrate and not all of them will be soft -- some will come out very leather-tough so reconstitute enough to allow for those that you have to discard. Also remember that these are huge when reconstituted."
1693,Is this Canadian Essiac Tea?,Yes it is. When we received and purchased it they said it was Cassi CanadianTea. Roger D.
1694,Is it gluten free?,"No, it's not gluten free. However, this wheat is not your normal, hybridized wheat consisting of 42 chromosomes per grain. It is reminiscent of the ancient wheat of biblical times, 16 chromosomes per grain. I don't think it's exactly the same as wheat from 2000 years ago because everything living mutates according to nature, but this flour is supposedly ground from wheat that is very close to the ancient wheat. I've baked with it, and it's consistency is wonderful, and reminds me of the wheat I had when grandma used to bake. My husband and I are both wheat sensitive, he more than I, and he can tolerate it quite well. We even use the Einkorn wheat pasta, and we have no problem with digestion. However, if you are a celiac sufferer, I would avoid it just to be sure. I would recommend reading ""Wheat Belly"" by Dr. William Davis. Just a note.

1697,Do the Keurig ground coffee adaptors work in the Cafejo?,"No, they do not. The Cafejo uses its own ground coffee adaptor and it is rather cheep flimsy built. With it the coffee comes out watery with all the holes in its sides. However take an used K-cup and cut off a small part of the top and put over it. When you do this the water will be forced threw the small hole in the bottom. As would if you are using a regular K- cup. K-cups seem larger size but when you cut one open you will see the filter and empty space. Your adaptor will use about the same amount of coffee. Regardless of the dent you see in its bottom to avoid hitting the lower pin."
1698,Do these need fertilizer?,"Yes they do.  You can use a succulent plant spray every month with watering. 17-8-22 is what I use.Good Luck, If you get into this I have a lot of babies to share."

1705,"What are good ways to display/present/keep this?  On some sort or plate, in a vase, etc.  I am fine with the smaller plants, but what to do with this?","For the first few days I had mine, I had it hanging. I made a hanger from some nylon cord. It looked great like that and ultimately I plan to have it hanging in my front window. Right now I have it in a clear glass bowl with pebbles in the bottom. It looks rather nice like that also. I have seen people take decorative plates and use the xerographica as a centerpiece. Some people get a nice wooden wreath, set the plant in it, and display it on the wall. There's lots of great ways to show off this awesome plant! A quick search on the Internet shows that some people are attaching it to larger bits of driftwood, putting it inside clear glass containers, using regular planters (without the soil, of course), attaching it to a wall or fence, or just sitting it on a shelf. Hope this helps! I really enjoy my xerographica and would recommend it!

1706,Change in blend? Anyone else notice that this coffee has changed flavor profile lately? Too acidic and bad aftertaste?,I've noticed no change. Still very good coffee in my estimation.

1730,What is the ingredient in swerve?,"According to the package, the ingredients are: Erythritol, Oligosaccharides and natural flavors."
1731,Does unopened package need refrigeration?,"Hi,No (though with an asterisk-like caveat)...The 32-ounce packages (and smaller) are, in fact, shelf-stable, and do not need to be refrigerated prior to opening. In a grocery store, one would tend to find the 32-ounce and smaller -sized versions of this product out 'on the floor', versus being sold out of a refrigerated case (though I realize that various grocery stores often put the milk variant shelf-stable items in refrigerated cases, largely at the behest of the manufacturer, in order to have such items seen as true 'competitor'-based alternatives to dairy milk (though when a from-what-I-can-tell-it-is-a-shelf-stable product I want to buy happens to be sold in such a way, I find myself 'holding my breath' a bit, as I set the item on a shelf, after arriving home)).However, the 64-ounce/half-gallon version of this product absolutely seems to need refrigeration prior to opening -- though there isn't a truly obvious indication of such. The non-shelf-stable nature of the half-gallon size is perhaps due in large part to the fact that the packaging is quite akin to that of dairy milk half-gallon containers (not the plastic ones, obviously), and as such, does not have the liquid-proof 'seal' -type 'outer layer' (a kind of quasi-'encasement') that is otherwise found on the packaging of the 32-ounce and smaller sizes of the almond milk.So, if you buy the half-gallon size from a grocery store (and they do sell two-pack versions of such, as well), be sure to refrigerate such 'from the get-go'. But for all other/smaller sizes -- including the size associated with this listing on Amazon -- they're shelf-stable, and do not need to be refrigerated before opening.

1732,why are you selling these for 11.98 here when they are $5.98 at Sam's Club?,For a little profit and to pay Amazon a lot of fees.
1733,Is this oil NON-Hydrogenated?,"Coconut oil is non-hydrogenated, rest assured. It looks like it because of being white and solid below 76 degrees. I use it to make biscuits but have to be careful handling it as it will turn to liquid in your hands, cut it in with a butter knife. This oil is for the most part a medium chain triglyceride, too, and all MCT's do not require your gall bladder to process the oil as it does literally every other oil, highly recommended for those without a gall bladder. If there is a magic oil, it's this (followed by olive oil), forget the rest. Always make sure they're extra virgin and cold pressed.

1734,is the mackerel in these cans skinless and boneless?,"It is boneless and skinless.  I eat everything in the can.  It's great on crackers.(NOTE: In an earlier version of this answer I said ""It is boneless, but not skinless.""  However, I was thinking of Cole's sardines, which are also excellent.  The mackerel is, in fact, skinless.  Sorry for the confusion.)"

As I have never heard of any cheddar cheese having gluten, I would have to say in my honest opinion....No. However, I am not a scientist nor a medical professional. Therefore, I am unqualified to give a medical opinion on this. However, I will say that this is the only cheese powder to be found in the USA that has no added sugars, salts, preservatives, anything else. It's ingredient is listed as cheddar cheese. That's it.

1750,"How much equals a tsp?  If it was in the product information I would have probably bought it, but I have no idea.",The bottle says 5 drops per serving which might mean teaspoon. I personally use 7-8 drops for a large cup of Keurig type coffee.

If I remember correctly, I should have made it so that it was chilled for at least 24 hrs because my grandson didn't like it the day I made it. It tasted better the next day. I don't think it would probably change the taste of what you're adding it to. I don't know what you're using it for though."
1770,will it stick to air popped (no oil) popcorn. I use the Presto Poplite hot air popper.,"In our experience, not really.  You might get away with trying to add the salt just as the popped corn leaves the popper to drop in the bowl since there may be a very slight bit of moisture present from the popping process (moisture escaping as the kernel pops) but, it is unlikely.  We use an air popper, as well but, we always add some butter mixed with olive oil.  Not so much for the salt, we just like the flavor.  Responder "" Franklin"" makes a good point, though; the salt is very finely ground and could easily get lodged in nooks & crannies of a popped kernel.  We just prefer more salt flavor than what we got without using a some oil.

1777,Where are the seeds from?,"I'm not sure exactly what the answer to this question is, but this it what I do know.  It doesn't say on the package where the sunflower seeds are from, but I'm guessing they are from the US since it doesn't say they're from China or anywhere else.  I don't know the area or state they are grown in, but I bought them from Net Rush on Amazon, and the package says they are distributed by Now Foods from Bloomingdale, IL 60108 USA.  Hope that helps."
1778,Would this work for hard candy like a jolly rancher?,"Perfectly, just don't go too strong."
1779,Need to know if there is any Canola Oil as part of the ingredients,I don't think so.  I believe it is regular vegetable oil.
1780,does it need to be refrigated after opening?,No
1781,how does the sodium content compare with soy sauce?,"It has 160 mg, which is way less than the reduced sodium soy sauce in my frig (550 mg).  Even with no salt added to this stuff, it's still really salty.  I even water it down a bit."
1782,What is up with the massive price increase?  Up from $39.00 to 54.99!  That is outrageous!!!!,That's a ridiculous price jump!! It's still $34.99 with $4.99 shipping directly from Honeyville..I'll be going back to ordering from them!! Disappointing!
1783,Fresh,"The bars I received on 3/15 say best before 17/09/14 and they taste fresh and wonderful. They won't last long here, I've already placed another order."
1784,"On a scale of 1 to 5, 0 being decaffeinated, what is the caffeine content? Thanks, Mark.","Probably ought to ask market spice tea . It's not decaf, but not real strong IMHO. Been drinking this stuff for over 45 years, and it's my favorite. Phone number for market spice is 800-735-7198."
1785,How about on formica countertops?  should I sand / prime first?,"I doubt that this wax is suitable for countertops of any kind.  It is primarily intended for use on such things as certain kinds of jewelry, picture frames, and decorative objects.  I have never used it for surfaces that have a lot of wear, such as countertops, and I don't think that would work well."
1786,Is this from grass-fed cows and pastured pork?,"If this product truly is grass fed and pasture raised, then why does it not give any reference whatsoever to this anywhere on the product container. It says absolutely nothing about being grass fed, organic, or pastured. Very suspicious that they won't claim it on the bottle, but only on their website in fine print. I doubt it's actually grass fed or pastures."
1787,"When it says enjoy 3-5 cups daily, are you expected to use a new tea bag for every cup of tea?","I brew 3 bags at one time with the proper amount of water (24oz for 3 bags) and I drink it for half of day then brew 3 more in the afternoon and drink it all by bedtime. I would not have the patience to drink a cup at a time. It has worked amazingly for me. I add almond, coconut or soy milk to mine."
1788,"What kind of expiration do these pods have? If I buy 150 of them and it takes me a year to get through them all, how will they taste by the end?",They are vacuumed sealed so just like a can of coffee the shelf life is a few years
1789,how many blooms are on the plant when you receive it,"NONE! It's up to you to provide the proper conditions for it to bloom. I have a green thumb but I had no luck with this plant. I kept it for about 1 year, then threw it out."
1790,how much does it make,not very much
1791,Is it dairy and gluten free,"I have used up my bag of dark chocolate callets but my bag of dark chocolate bittersweet callers contains unsweetened chocolate, sugar, cocoa, soy lecithin as an emulsifier, natural vanilla flavor. It is gluten-free yet it also contains a warning that it may contain milk (maybe because it is produced in a place where milk is used as in its milk chocolate? I am not sure). To be 100% sure, you should contact Callebaut via its website. The block of dark chocolate is dairy and gluten free."
1792,If I eat enough of these will I turn into Macho Man Randy Savage?,yes
1793,"What are the ingredients? Mainly concerned about High Fructose Corn Syrup, artificial colorings and aspertame/ aminosweet.","Cane sugar, red 40, and blue 1"
1794,Are you getting 4 boxes of 8oz. each baking chocolate?,"I used to buy the 8 oz. boxes but about 2 months ago they were replaced by 4 oz. boxes. Biggest disadvantage is that the price per oz. almost doubled! Have noticed this with many other food products also, everything from ice cream to cereal to soup to bread."
1795,Is this product processed on shared lines with peanuts or tree nuts?,"It is not said in the label it has. It comes from Bolivia and Domenican Republic, Could be from other country also  but I do not think this product is procesed  on shared lines with peanuts or tree nuts."
1796,How long will the jerky last?,"Well, I bought it in October of 2013 & the best before use date was September of 2014. Once the package is open, I do not know for sure. Hopefully that helps you."
1797,Can you cook this barley and eat it?,"You can cook and eat this barley, however, you may not enjoy it because it is unhulled. I would suggest buying hulled barley, where the seed hull has been removed (think about eating sunflower seeds with the shell still on, versus without it). If you want to grind this unhulled barley into flour, it would be fine for that. But for the sake of eating, I would definitely go for hulled barley. Enjoy!"
1798,Do you add any oil to the raisins?,No...I didn't even know people did that!  :)
1799,How much flour should be used for a bread-machine recipe?,"If you are using Bob's Red Mill Gluten free bread mix you do not add any flour it is in the mix already.  You will need to add eggs, milk, oil, and 1teaspoon of cider vinegar.  The directions are on the package.  Follow your Bread machines instructions and the package instructions.  It makes a good size loaf of bread, which is very tasty and very filling."
1800,I just purchased the yogurt maker and am confused.  Why is using the homemade batch as the new starter a no-no?,"I always use my homemade batch as a starter.  My first batch I divide up into 3 tablespoon servings into multiple ziplock snack bags that I put in the freezer. The culture will keep when frozen, plus it is your strongest batch. Make another batch with 3 tbl spoons from the 1st batch. Then I eat my yogurt and leave over about 3 tbs for the next batch over and over until one batch seems a little too loose, then go to the freezer and start over.  Think of the savings!!!"
1801,Is the one ounce bag a serving size with 15 carbs?,"I have the6.8 ounce back, with ~ 7 servings, each 1 ounce serving is said to have 16 grams of carbohydrates."
1802,are these vegan/vegetarian friendly?,"No, they have gelatin in them which is an animal product."
1803,Would someone mind posting all the ingred's in the order they're listed? Trying to find lower-sodium items... Thanks!,This one has high sodium. I rarely use it.

1805,"Sweet Rice, aka Glutinous Rice, does not traditionally contain gluten and is a gluten free product, does this brand really contain gluten?","Hi Faye, I am going to quote from Wikipedia about Glutinous Rice and here it is...""Glutinous rice (Oryza sativa var. glutinosa; also called sticky rice, sweet rice or waxy rice) is a type of rice grown mainly in Southeast and East Asia, which has opaque grains, very low amylose content, and is especially sticky when cooked. It is called glutinous (< Latin glūtinōsus)[1] in the sense of being glue-like or sticky, and not in the sense of containing gluten.""So I would have to say the it does not contain gluten."

1812,"Which were the best ""experiments"" anyone has tried? Type of yogurt? Flavored yogurt? Additions?",Taking old candy canes crushing them in a baggie then adding them to the mix was tasty but did leave the brownies very gooey and I ate too many as I tried to cut them out of the pan. My favorite mixture is one Activa vanilla with greek plain yogurt to equal the 2/3 cup needed in the recipe.  Makes perfect texture brownies plus added protein.
1813,what is the caffiene content?,No caffeine content  is listed on canister; I assume it must be an insignificant amount.
1814,"The can is BPA free, but is it also free from bps, phthalates, and other hormone disrupters?",I have bought these for years and don't see anything on the can that indicates anything other than bpa.  I would call the manufacturer directly.

1819,how many ounces/pounds do you get for this item?,3.5 oz.
1820,Are these made by Hershey's in the US or are they made in the UK or Canada? The US version uses corn syrup. UK or Canada use pure cane sugar.C,"Others have already answered your actual question correctly, but I just wanted to say that the Cadbury Dairy Milk bars produced by Hersheys in the US have never contained corn syrup as far as I recall. I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm not. It's the Creme Eggs that contain corn syrup, and I don't think it's part of the chocolate. It's in the filling."
1821,Anyone have any good recipes using this mix? Thanks!,"Saute 1 cup each of diced red onion, celery (including leaves), organic carrots, and fresh mushrooms (any type) for 3-5 minutes.  Add 2 cups ofBob's Red Mill Vegi Soup Mix, 8 cups water and 3 cups fat free chicken broth.  Simmer for 50-60 minutes, season with kosher salt and ground pepper."
1822,How many T or tsps. are used for an 8 oz. serving?,I use 1-2 TB per 8 ounces depending on how strong you want it.  Sometimes I like to add a little milk for richness then I might use a little extra mix so it is nice a dark.  I like my cocoa strong flavored

1828,Does this pot work on an induction stovetop?  It must have a magnetic bottom to work with induction.,I'm guessing it will work on an induction stove as it happily clings to a magnet.
1829,Why does this product have dextrose in it? I didn't expect to be adding sugar with my salt. I might return it.,"Dextrose is added to stabilize the iodide. Iodine is vital to the proper functioning of the thyroid gland and the prevention of goiter. Personally I have changed to Himalayan pink sea salt. Not because of the dextrose addition, but because it is more pure and very tasty when used in my crock pot meals."

This is just the information that had been passed on to me by an herbalist. I am not a professional herbalist.
1837,What are the ingredients? Why would you NOT have an ingredient list on a food supplement? I do not use anything with gelatin which is frequently used.,"Firstly gelatin does cause allergic reactions to some people & may get serious too.Then Muslims are not allowed to use non-halal sources.Vegitable based items are safe & all religions allow its use.IMHO if a medication; specially non-allopathic, helps improve better life over should use it!I hope you get the idea!"
1838,Are these already peeled? From the questions above one said they are not peeled 3 said they are? The description on the bag is not helpful..,They are not shelled.  They come with a green shell that must be soaked for 24 hours and then taken off.  Time consuming but delicious when cooked.

There really isn't that much difference which tree or which honey other than the absurd price.  Any honey will work.  I have been using honey on wounds since the early 80's.  I was told about it by a Medicine Woman on one of our Indian Reservations.  Indians have used it for hundreds of years.  It works better than anything I have ever used, over the counter and prescribed.  Even my doctor agrees and since 2006 it's been used by the medical professionals and approved by the FDA.  I tried the Manuka, and I've used honey I buy in the health food store as well as the grocery store.  They all work, the health food store honey seems the best.  And it's way cheaper.  It heals a wound faster that anything around and helps take the pain away as well.  I had foot surgery and it just wouldn't heal, I finally quit using the stuff the doctor gave me and started using honey, it healed in not time, the doctor was impressed.

Show Less","Yeah, it's insane.  Though, it says in the product description ""Four/ 12 oz 6packs"", so I'm not sure if this is a pack of six or FOUR packs of six, in which case it's not really a bad deal (like, $.71/can or something like that).  Still, probably better just to get it at a store."

1863,Do they outgrow the pot they are planted in? And if so how and what do you use to replant?,"Oh yeah they do. You should repot immediately after purchase to avoid shocking them later.

1880,Do I have to plant it?  I live in an apartment.  Do I grind it to flour?  How much flour does it make?  I don't understand but very interested.,"No, you do not *have* to plant wheat berries. You may do with them as you wish: sprout, cook, grind. And they make as much flour as they make--no more, no less.

1898,"Does anyone know color this is supposed to be? White on package photo, but realized while eating it was an odd color. And are the white flecks normal?","It probably settled.  What does the expiration date say?  I love hemp milk, it does have a long shelf life, make sure you shake it up good!Make sure the carton was totally sealed, and no air got in.

1913,Does Pack of 3 mean you get 3 boxes of the 48 bags?,Yes. It's a great deal!

How long can an open jar be stored unrefrigerated/","I just received my jar and am looking at the storage directions now. ""Best By 10/2014. Store in a cool, dry and dark place. Use within 3 months after opening or refrigerate.""So what this says to me is that, unopened, it's best by October 2014 (10 months from now). Once opened, it should be used within 2-3 months if stored in a cabinet (someplace dark and cool), OR it can be refrigerated to last longer, although it doesn't specify by how much."
1916,How many Tablespoons or Cups are in 16 oz (1 lb) of sprinkles?,"It's not an apples to apples comparison since one is a measure of weight/mass and the other is volume. However, I weighed a 1/3 cup of sprinkles and it was 2.5 ounces. Hope that helps."

1919,May I have a list of the ingredients please?,"I just bought a bottle by accident (I meant to buy the butter flavor, not butter vanilla) and my ingredients are different than others' ingredients:water, propylene glycol, modified food starch, xanthan gum, citric acid, titanium dioxide, potassium sorbate, partially hydrogenated soybean oil... not a fan of any of these ingredients really... it's kinda sad that an extract needs trans fats in it?"
1920,what is the shelf life of these?,The tomatoes have been good for a year after purchase.  I've extended the quality of other dried food by putting them in the freezer.
1921,how man candies in ea.bag?,About 30. I had an open bag with 23 left and probably ate ~7. Hope that helps.
1922,Which color is the watermelon flavor? My boyfriend is allergic and I'd like to know if I could easily spot and pick those out.,"the watermelon is the baby blue colored one, dont think you need to worry since its artificial flavoring. the bag comes with a guide on the back that tells you which is which. hope that helps."
1923,"If I order today 1/7/15, what is the exiration date on the box?","I got a box in early December, around the first week. The box is stamped March 2, 2015. I think that you get 3 months to consume the product. It does say that no refrigeration is needed. I have bought this product for a number of years without any problem. I hope that this helps."
1924,Do you lay the sheets crosswise?  With only 3 sheets per layer there are gaps in between noodles and at the edges.,They expand a lot.  Don't over lap them or lay crosswise.
1925,Fair trade?,"I no longer have this product but I remember it said ""fair trade"" on the label. Googling the Injoy company would give you more info."
1926,How many candy bars are in the 12.5 ounce bag?,"Just opened an 11 oz bag which contained 14 fun size bars, so individually, they must be about 4/5 oz each. I'd expect to have 16 bars in a 12.5 oz bag."
1927,is the can bpa free?,I was able to go to the website www.wildplanetfoods.com and it does say that the wild sardines are packed in cans that are bpa free. You may check it for yourself. I am still not sure about the Wild Planet Tuna.
1928,"I like fish flavored nori, does this one have fishy taste?","No, it's not fishy.  You may want to try Wakame seaweed as it is the fishiest."
1929,Is the shell edible?,"I'm not sure if there's a ""shell"" but you can eat the whole bean. They are somewhat bitter but I like them."
1930,is it bleached white rice or naturally white ? And does it still contain the bran or has it been cleaned away ?,"It's white rice. No bran. If it had bran, it would be brown rice. I don't know if it was bleached. It's delicious, though!"
1931,Why did the subscription suddenly end and the price sky rocket without warning for black raspberry,"Every time I look at this the price goes up.  Apparently Amazon doesn't stop price gouging.  I certainly won't buy this at this price when Dollar General, Wal*Mart and other local stores carry it for $1.00 a bottle, all varieties. It WAS a good deal when the price was much lower.  The silence of the seller on this topic speaks volumes."
1932,how long after expiration date can you use it?I have a 2 yr. old jar,I used mine for at least four years after purchase and it still stood up well in things like quick breads and cinnamon rolls.
1933,Is this a BPA lining free container?,I don't know.  How can you find out?
1934,are the crackers gluten free?,"I'm afraid I don't know as I ordered them and had them delivered to someone as a gift. You should be able to get an answer to your question from the sellers, though. Sorry I can't be of more help."
1935,What are the dimensions of these bags?,"Bags are 16"" x 11 1/2""  x 7"""
1936,Is it 6 packs each including 6 packets or its just 1 pack with 6 packets inside?,"It's a little box with 7 packets. By right if it's not sold by Starbucks, it's 7 packets. From Starbucks itself, 6 packets. I don't know why it is like that."
1937,is this unrefined?,"According to Vitacost their coconut oil is ""Certified organic, non-GMO coconut oil. Cold pressed without the use of heat or chemicals and packaged in BPA-free jars.""  I have used this for a year and it is of a superior quality."
1938,Why do you call this rice gourmet?  Are there other ingredients besides rice?,It is allowed to grow naturally and without any artificial fertilizers and insecticides and then is harvested by Indians by hand from canoes as was done many moons ago.  That and the fact that it is super good and nutritious.  It can also be blended with other rice types for those who want the extra flavor but not as strong.
1939,How much sodium is there in one cup of Imagine Low Sodium Chicken Broth?,"There are 115 mg. of sodium in one cup of Imagine Low Sodium Chicken Broth.  I like that I can add the amount of salt I want, or none at all.  It's the best Chicken Broth I've ever used."

1942,How well does this do in cakes etc? It is a pastry flour and i thought not the right flour for cakes muffins?,"I find that I don't like this in cakes. The bran changes the ratio of gluten to fat and liquid, which is essential in cake making. However, I really like this flour in quick breads because they are supposed to be more dense. It also works wonders in cookies, waffles, and pancakes."
1943,Are there other ingredients besides Hibiscus in the product? I purchase Traditional Medicinals brand and it also contains blackberry & lemongrass.,Hi Anita! The only thing in this tea is hibiscus.
1944,is this 24 ounce or 8 ? picture shows 8.,"I Ordered & Received 3 Containers, each are 8 ounces."
1945,Do you have to store the sprouted flour any special way?,I store mine in the freezer so it doesn't go rancid.
1946,what is the shelf life?,"Don't know the answer...not sure anyone does. A quote from the National Cannery Association:""Canned food has a shelf life of at least two years from the date of processing. Canned food retains its safety and nutritional value well beyond two years, but it may have some variation in quality, such as a change of colour and texture. Canning is a high-heat process that renders the food commercially sterile. Food safety is not an issue in products kept on the shelf or in the pantry for long periods of time. In fact, canned food has an almost indefinite shelf life at moderate temperatures (75° F and below). Canned food as old as 100 years has been found in sunken ships and it is still microbiologically safe! We don't recommend keeping canned food for 100 years, but if the can is intact, not dented or bulging, it is edible.""

1948,How many digestible carbs per serving when the fiber amount is subtracted?,"I'm not sure what digestible carbs are, but if you look at the photo of the label, you see that the total carbs per serving is 17g and 11g of those is fiber. So, I would assume the answer is 6g? I hope this helps."
1949,it is cold pressed?,"There is no heat added, as it is raw.  Raw means no higher that 118 degrees."
1950,where is product grown?  Thank you.,California.
1951,does this water have added sugar,"There is no added sugar; however, there is more natural sugar than other brands.  I believe it's from the sheer quantity of pulp in each can.  Someone else said it may be the region the coconuts are from.  In any case, no added sugar and the best tasting coconut water/pulp I've ever had."
1952,that sounds expensive for 10 individual capsules; at the store it's less.  Where is the bargain to order through Amazon?,"It is expensive.  this is one of the few times that Amazon doesn't have the best price.  Go to the Nespresso website. Most of the capsules are 65 cents.  There is a minimum of 50, but you can choose different flavors.  Even with the $6.95 shipping charge the cost per capsule is 79 cents....less than the $1.18 on Amazon."

1955,What are the dimensions of the boxes?,6.5 inches tall by 4.5 inches. Perfect size for families and parties.
1956,does the carmel syrup come with a pump,You get a pump with every bottle. Here is a hint. If you try to put the pump in a brand new (completely full) bottle the syrup splooges out of the bottle. Use a little from the bottle before putting in the new pump and save yourself some clean-up.
1957,"""Nothing compares to the flavor, nutrition and value offered by Wild Planet!"" What does this even mean?","They are truly delicious!  I disliked sardines my whole life until I tried the Wild Planet brand.  They are so fresh, light, moist and never overly ""fishy"".  They are sustainabley caught and filled with omegas, calcium and potassium.  This is the only brand I trust."
1958,is this product non gmo?,"It isn't listed on the package, but on their website FAQs: ""Are your products genetically modified?No. All of our products originate from identity-preserved, non-GMO seeds. This means that the seed planted in the ground is non-GMO. We do not guarantee the complete absence of GMO materials in our products because of wind drift, pollinators and our lack of testing equipment."""
1959,Is this a non-gmo product?,"Yes, it is non-GMO.  I will quote from Bob's Red Mill FAQ: Are your products genetically modified?No. All of our products originate from identity-preserved, non-GMO seeds. This means that the seed planted in the ground is non-GMO. We do not guarantee the complete absence of GMO materials in our products because of wind drift, pollinators and our lack of testing equipment.I bake with this mix every week.  FYI, it bakes up much better if you mix the oil, eggs (and in my case a bit of added sugar) first, then add the mix and mix until the grains are coated.  Then slowly add the milk as you mix.  I bake this in a lightly heated cast iron skillet and it makes enough for my family of three to have fresh, then freeze enough for two more meals together.  Good stuff!

1960,how many does one 12 oz make?,It made like 25 cotton candys and very good flavor!!
1961,Does it give color to hair?,I won't say that it adds color to your hair but  it does enhance your natural color more. The difference isn't dramatic but you'll notice your natural highlights stand out more in the sun.
1962,what is god for,I'm guessing this is a typo and you want to know what this is good for?  I use the seeds to make milk.  It's a tasty alternative to dairy. I use it on my cereal or as a base for smoothies.
1963,Why would I get this particular type of rice instead of the Bomba rice I've used before?  What is the difference between the two?,"I have used calasparra and bomba. I buy whatever is cheaper and don't have a problem with either. From what I understand (from what I have read) they are both excellent for paella. They both absorb a lot of moisture. According to Carmen & Lola, bomba gets fatter when it expands and calasparra gets longer. I didn't look, I just ate them."
1964,Does anybody know where these are grown? I cannot tell by the label where they are from,"I checked with AZ Chia products and below is a statement from their website:Chia is grown in most countries of the Americas, from Mexico to Argentina. ""Our seed comes from South America, with the seed stock originating in Mexico"". Hope this helps."
1965,Does the Ekobrew allow grounds in your cup? I hate grounds in my coffee. Does this product allow grounds or powder in your coffee cup after use?,Same for me too!  I just received this and I've tried two different manufacturers ground drip coffee and both resulted in quite a bit of sediment.  Not good at all to say the least!!
1966,does this product have to be stored in the fridge before it is opened?,"Miso should be refrigerated after opening. I have transferred the contents of my open packet to a glass airtight container. Should be good for up to about 8 months. The still ""new"" sealed packet is stored in my pantry."
1967,Is this refined or unrefined ?,"This is definitely refined. A easy giveaway is the packaging - coconut oil is solid and only liquifies at 76 degrees or greater which is why it's sold in jars not bottles.I prefer to buy the huge jar of raw, unrefined coconut oil that way it has multiple uses and there's no degradation in the effectiveness."
1968,what is the exp date on this cereal?,Ours was August 2014
1969,the recommended dose is 3 to 9 grams a day of corydalis.  What does that measurement amount to?,"1/2 teaspoon. If it affects bowel movements, cut down to 1/4 tsp."

I hope the skin+bones are still here!:?,"According to info on side of can there are 64 mg sodium per 1/4 cup serving. The skin and bones are present. This is delicious, hopefully healthy salmon with a definite low-salt taste. My only concern is the possible BPA epoxy coating linings in the can? Servings per can: about 3.5; Ingredients: wild Alaskan sockeye salmon with natural broth to be consumed"
1973,what is expiration date?,Good afternoon all the Remaining Stock that I have all expire *** AUGUST 2015. I hope to serve you. Thank You! (SavingsMadeEZ)
1974,how many calories in each cup,there are 10 calories in each container
1975,does it create a good color ? The RUB from Killer Hogs makes my ribs a nice mahogany color..but not sweet enough.. has anyone used both ? compare them,Yes. Great color.   Also diff woods will give u diff color as well. I typically use Apple but I've done oak and pecan and it had a good mahogany color.   U can also just add paprika to any rub and will add color but not much of a taste
1976,Can anyone tell me if these will float in a punch bowl?,"They are like ""gummie bears""...so try it out with gummie bears and if they float, these will.  I bought them, but didn't float them.  They are very light...I would think so."
1977,what are the flavors included,"Caramel, Mint, French Vanilla and Regular"
1978,approx # of cookies in box,"I buy these cookies in the wintertime (northeast USA). They are absolutely delicious and very festive.  They come in a nice (reusable) tin box and there are two trays of cookies.  There at least 15 different types with 4 of each type per tray -- so that is 120 cookies in total in the whole box.  The Belgium chocolate is really good and the variety across the different types is light/milk/dark chocolate covering over some type of shortbread cookie or sugar wafer style.  Probably more than you asked, but I think these are well worth the price, especially if you are setting a nice buffet or having a party and want to get that extra 'oomf'.  I first tasted these during a class I was teaching in Germany and asked the host for more info about the cookies they served during the break.  They provided me with some to take home back to Pennsylvania and since then I've waited for cooler weather so I can order them on line.  Amazon has been a great location to order from, packaged well and always arrive in good shape.  5 out of 5 star rating from me.

1980,"what is the differance in soft white and hard white wheat, which would probley be the best to get?","Soft white wheat is more suitable for biscuits, cakes and muffins.  Hard white wheat is more suitable for breads.  What kind you should get depends on what you plan to use it for."
1981,Will this be 20 DIFFERENT teas?  Some reviews mentioned duplicates and I want to be sure it's 20 DIFFERENT flavors before I order it.  Thanks.,yes some duplicates. plus a lot of super sweet cups specifically for iced tea that are disgusting hot. don't buy this one
1982,What is the expiry date?,July 15 2015
1983,How much caffeine is in one of these K-cups?,"I actually don't know. But I can say that I don't get that jittery feeling from drinking the Starbucks Verona.  Some different brands in k-cups can get me jittery, not the Starbucks brand"
1984,My gumball machine will give out 2 gumballs almost every 2nd or 3rd rotation. How do I stop this and get it to only give out 1 gumball per quarter?,Sounds like it's a matter of a simple adjustment. Please call our office at 800 853 3941 and we'll be happy to assist you.
1985,"Greetings, will you combine shipping for an order of say four 6packs? thanks",I ordered three packs and was charged $5.99 shipping for each pack ($18) and they arrived in one box!  I was pretty angry.  I wrote them and they said they can't combine because of the way Amazon was set up.  They said they sent me a refund but I never really saw it.  I won't order again or if I do it will only be one box.
1986,Is it for Kurig coffee makers,"Yes they are K cups. I love San Francisco Bay coffee's any favor. They are the best. I would like to add, I do not throw the k cup away after I have used it. I cut the filter off and dump the coffee grounds into a dish and than I add those coffee grounds to my flower and veggie gardens. So do recycle the coffee grounds into your gardens."

1990,is this instant?,Yes
1991,"Since this comes in a container like normal peanut butter, can you mix all of the water in ahead of time and store it?","Yes you could do that, but I think it would defeat the purpose of having a product that unmixed needs no special storage and has unlimited shelf life. Whereas once water is added, and the product does contain a form of coconut sugar, there may be a chance of spoilage.  Additionally I would think you would need a larger container if you chose to hydrate the entire contents."
1992,does anyone have directions,Directions?! Just make it like you normally make coffee!! It's so delicious!!
1993,how much sodium in this sauce?,115mg per 2 tablespoons

1996,Does making the larger cup size weaken the coffee significantly?,"Actually, I haven't found it to make a significant difference.  Of course, consider your current brewing preference.  Compared to a French Press, the coffee is weaker.  Another thing I found makes larger cups richer and more flavorful is to use EkoBrew refillable K-cups and my own ground coffee.  It's much cheaper and you can adjust the results by the amount of coffee."
1997,"Will these hold the Wide Awake k-cups? They come in little pouches kind of like a filter rather than ""cups"" anyone know?",Can't help about Wide-awake cups. They hold the regular K-cup by friction of just pushing them in the holes tight. Works good for us in our camper.
1998,What is the right steeping temperature? 220?,"It needs to be just shy of boiling. I pour at about 208, given that it will cool slightly while it is pouring. Anything higher than that brings out unpleasant bitter. Hope you enjoy this excellent infusion."
1999,Are these decorations gluten free?,"The ingredient list is: sugar, egg white solids, modified corn starch, sodium lauryl sulfate and then blue, red and yellow coloring. Hope this helps!"
2000,Do I add more packets/bag per 20 oz water for longer strenuous day hikes?,"I wouldn't. Proper intake is one bottle of sqwincher mix then 3 bottles of water. Then sqwincher,  then water etc. To much sqwincher without enough water can make you sick. You can add for taste or double up as long as you are kicking back straight water after."
2001,Is almond meal the same thing as almond flour?,"Lots of people use the terms synonymously and the bottomline is that both are just finely ground almonds. The difference is whether you want almond meal with or without the skins. Without the skins is more expensive, but if you're baking cakes or just want a lighter taste, then it's best to go with the almond meal without skins. If you're OK with a more heartier taste, then save some money and get almond meal with the skins on. I've been using Trader Joe's almond meal for about a year and still can't believe it's only $4.00 for a full pound. I've searched extensively and no one's price comes close. It tastes like fresh almonds. Honeyville Farms has great almond flour without the skins and the grind is consistent (as it Trader Joes'). The problem I find with Bob's Red Mill almond meal without the skins is that the grind is inconsistent and you can really tell. Hope this helps!

Use the best quality you can get -unrefined, cold-pressed, which will not contain chemical residues.

Coconut oil is also a very good oil without a harsh taste and very light but it's not cheap is the only down fall."
2026,Can you verify this order is 10 pack for $45 or 10 capasules for $45? It's not clear enough on the detail,Well let's see 10 capsules for $45.00 would be an outrageous price ...but 10 sleeves of 10 capsules each for $45.00 would be more realistic ..but they are hazelnut and they don't make them anymore so ..maybe $4.50 a capsule instead of 6$ for 10 capsules ..is the going rate
2027,Why isn't this umf or GMO rated?,"It doesn't appear to carry a UMF or MGO rating and chances are it wouldn't qualify, i.e. it's probably less ""active"" than UMF 5+ or MGO 100.

2043,Are these sulphured ?,"yes unless specifically labeled ""unsulphured""...the sulphur preserves the bright orange color, unsulphered apricots are brown in color"

Bad!",I'm looking at the bottle now and it only says that it is 100% Balsamic Vinegar.  It is also my favorite and you only need a little bit to get the full flavor on a salad.

2049,what is the shelf life,"I always keep the seeds in the refrigerator and have had no problem with sprouting as long as a year after purchase.  I learned the hard way that if seeds are stored in a place that's too warm, it will cause them to fail to sprout even after a few months."

2057,Are these difficult to use? to wrap your food in? do they break easily? should you do something to them to soften them before you wrap it around food?,"These wraps aren't difficult to use, just not as thick as the flour wraps, or need to be softened. They're fine for whatever food you'd like to wrap (i.e. BLT wrap, chicken, tuna or ham salad wrap, etc.), the possibilities are endless. If you use one wrap or two, you'll find that they're delicious, easy use, and don't have to be refrigerated."

2061,"What's the shelf life, because it may take me a while to consume 5 lbs?","I have had my usual Now brand on the shelf for a year and no problems. Just keep your bag sealed or put it in a storage container. CAUTION: if you have dogs, this is lethal so keep it put up out of their reach. It passes through human bodies unabsorbed which is similar to how the gas medicine simethicone works. It does not spike my glucose levels and has the least net carb effect of any sugar alcohol and less gastrointestinal upset risk than xylitol. I have used it in baking, ice cream making and beverages just fine. You will have to play with texture (dissolving the crystals may need some help or pulverize them in a blender, etc...) or amounts. It is considered to be 70% as sweet as table sugar but we find it can actually taste sweeter to us but then we are on ketogenic dietary protocols to control my diabetes and when you get sugar and excess carbs out of your system everything tastes sweeter, more intense, cleaner and absolutely delightful.

2063,What percent of the product is coconut water?,i have reached out to inedible to ask this question as well as ask why they are not using organic products (they could be using organic grape juice and organic/raw coconut water)- especially considering the price point.  i have emailed 3 times and as of yet no one has responded.  it's honestly making me question the company and their integrity.  i will report back when/if i actually hear from someone.

It doesn't have sugar or flavorings. like malted milk powders, but does have 31 grams of carbs. You can add this to Alba shakes, or Nestles to make a drink have a malt flavor.  A tablespoon or so added to bread recipes is divine.  So-no sugar and no artificial flavoring-just good old malt. I use it in Alba Shakes and it DOES give a pleasant malty flavor."

With globalization more and more porcini are coming from these areas for cooks to enjoy and savor.""I have had great success with these mushrooms and continue to buy them, but I suspect they are imported from several countries.

2172,192 Ounces? 24 x 0.8Oz = 192 Oz according to amazon.,Hmmm....must be that new math where you drop the decimal point completely out of the equation.
2173,What kind of sugar is thsi particular soda made with?  Cane or refined sugars?,Pure Cane Sugar
2174,Does this come in a glass or plastic bottle?   I encourage all food manufactures to go back to glass.  I do my best to AVOID plastic in my food.,Mine did come in a glass bottle.  Hope that helps.
2175,Are they actually addictive? O_o,"Yes, instead of salt, they must dust them with crack. I can't seem to get enough! �"
2176,Are these papaver somniferum seeds unwashed?,"These are GARBAGE if you are looking for P. Som unwashed! Go with ""Food to live""..  they take 4-5 days to get to me but well worth it.. Give HIGH remarks.. VERY HIGH."
2177,"What are the ingredients of this product? It states it is True Lemon, but then the description says, ""Perfect balance of lime, garlic & cilantro""...?","Someone appears to have done a poor job on the description, the True Lemon *lemon* should just be *lemon*. If you take a close look at the images you can see the ingredient list.The True Lemon brand also produces a lemon, garlic, and cilantro version, which I have not tried, among other things.The regular, lemon-only, True Lemon stuff is just lemon, and I've been occasionally using it to make lemonade.Based on other info here on Amazon, if you're not putting it into things that will be cooked, get the packets or maybe the small shaker bottles (see comments on the 10.6 oz shaker bottles). There's some indication that there's a difference between the large and small package contents.

2178,"Are these sardines one or two layer.  Also, how do they compare with the King Oscar Tiny Tots sardines in the yellow package?","Looks like I'm the only one who's actually had KO Tiny Tots.  My guess is that Tiny Tots ane Double Layers come from the same batches of fish...the Tiny Tots are just the best of them.  My experience is that the Tiny Tots are slightly smaller, perhaps 4 more fish per tin.  I can get Tiny Tots for $2.52 at Wal-Mart, so no need to order from Amazon.  If you can't get Tiny Tots at a good price locally, these Double Layers are a good next option."
2179,Are these dates coated with sugar? I was going to purchase some of the Sun Maid Brand until I read that they are.,"They are not coated.  I found them to be quite good!  I've used them in baking & as is with some almond butter, coconut butter, or just stuffed with a pecan!"
2180,How long does it stay fresh?,"I keep mine in the fridge after opening and only grind right before using.  The bag lasts me slightly less than a month, so I never have any freshness issues."
2181,calorie count?,"Not really sure...but it does come in fat free , sugar free and low fat"
2182,Can you tell me what is the expiration date?,The product is extremely fresh with a six month code.
2183,Does this product contain soy or casein? Does the box say if it is manufactured in a factory that deals with soy or other gluten products?,"It cannot contain casein as it is not listed at the Nature's Path web site. Their site states ""Produced in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts or soy."" That means it could have some soy dust or such.I avoid casein, and if the cereal box I had stated there was casein, I would not have eaten it.Read my original 3 Star review for my comments about Nature's Path Organic Whole O's cereal. I have not eaten this cereal since my purchase that spurred my review."
2184,Hello. I would like to know the exact dimensions of your pop corn bags. Thank you!,"Pleated bottom, 3.5 x 8 when flat, opens to 2""We sell for $1 at events"
2185,How much time do we have to eat them?,"At least until the ""better if used by"" date on the box top. For example, 14JUN2014 means it is suggest it is better to eat it before June 14, 2014. Stored under extremely hot conditions such as an un-cooled shed in Death Valley, it might begin to taste a bit stale before this date and it might taste fresh long after this date in a freezer. This cereal must be packed very well, as the ""better if used by"" date is many months in the future if the cereal is bought just shortly after it is made."
2186,Please tell me the soduim content and other relevant food content.                                          Amazon should tell the entire food content,"1 serving is 3 decent size pancakes and 450 mg. salt, 180 calories, 30 from fat, 25 cholesterol 140 potassium 36g carbs 5g fiber 6g protien.  They are good with banana and dark chocolate chips"
2187,I've tried this Toasted Southern Pecan coffee and it is great. Should it be stored in the refrigerator or does it not matter?,Refrigerated coffee will always stay fresher. So it depends how fast you plan on using it.
2188,how large (tall) are the stalks?,"They look bigger in the pictures, mine(I bought 4) were about 7 inches tall on average. Although it has grown about double that in 4 months. It's a small plant, but I am really enjoying mine. And I recommend buying the bamboo fertilizer and once a week use 2 drops."
2189,How is this new (brown) hazelnut coffee/packaging different from the usual orange looking hazelnut coffee/packaging?,"The new recipe is AWFUL. Bitter, chalky aftertaste, no hazelnut flavor. Yuck. Which dumbass at Nescafe thought the recipe change was a good idea?"
2190,"do they have a taste and if so, what does it taste like?","Well, the ingredients are miraculin and potato starch, so... it tastes starchy. Imagine you dehydrated a slice of potato and took a bite of it."
2191,Is the packaging of the TimTams secure enough to keep the cookies fresh in my pantry if they were not opened for over a month?,I believe so.  Yes.
2192,"can you airbrush these colors onto cloth, and will it dry?",You can but it is food coloring so when the cloth gets wet the colors will run and mostly wash out.
2193,what does turbinado mean?,"Raw light-brown coarse sugar that has been steam-cleaned, made from the first crystallization of cane juice and retaining some molasses"
2194,Carbs?,2tablespoons has 5 carbs
2195,"Since this is a suggested as a Hanukkah gift, is it Kosher?","These cookies are awesome!  Great gift for any occasion - unfortunately, you can only get them during the holidays.  I've ordered for a couple years now and never have opened a packet with a broken cookie."
2196,"Does any of you guys have the same experience as me, received the cake and saw that the outer surface was fully covered with white mould?","I ordered two, and they were great. Sorry yours was not.  The packaging might have been open.Sue D"
2197,Is this lard hydrogynated?,Yes it says so right on the front.
2198,how many carbs per serving?,31 grams of Total Carbohydrate 10% Daily Value. According to the container.
2199,"What is the nutrition information on this product, calories, fat etc.",http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/nutrition-calories/food/cafe-essentials/mocha-java-powder/This site has the nutrition info.
2200,"Dear Sir, Pls let me know what is your expiry date exactly? TKS.","Sorry,I have ate it."
2201,How does this compare to the Crema e Gusto?,Blu to me is a stronger coffee with smooth rich velvety finish. The Crema e Gusto was strong but the flavor reminds of a strong cup of Folgers.
2202,How sweet are these granola bars?  Do they taste like dessert?,Not super sweet - natural tasting
2203,Is this quinoa pre-rinsed?,"No it is not, I recently switched to Truroots because this had so much fluff..."
2204,What size vase do you recommend for 25 giant long stemmed roses?,"I used a 13"" vase for my roses. I cut about 2"" off of each stem and that seemed to work pretty well. You could probably even go taller. You could use a shorter vase if you like, but you would have to trim off more of the stems. Also, it's a good idea if your vase is about 5"" wide as 25 roses takes up quite a bit of width."
2205,How many Tablespoons or Cups are in 16 oz (1 lb) of sprinkles?,"It's not an apples to apples comparison since one is a measure of weight/mass and the other is volume. However, I weighed a 1/3 cup of sprinkles and it was 2.5 ounces. Hope that helps."
2206,Are you selling 6 boxes of 10 pakets(total of 60 packets) for thre price advertised?,Be very careful when you are shopping this item.  I purchased what I thought to be an entire case as you described in your question only to receive 3 boxes instead of the 6.  I now only buy from Amazon fulfilling only because other listing are deceptively priced.  I pay around 35.00 for a full case. .6 boxes.   I hope this feedback helps you.
2207,What does it taste like?,"I enjoy it but the taste for this type of product is a very personal experience.  I have read other reviews of people who might not like it but I am someone who enjoys natural tasting things.  I don't like something having a very sweet tasting chocolate and this does not.  You might want to go to a local Whole Food Store or some type of health food store as they usually sell one serving packets.  This way you can taste it before buying.  I did this when I bought another product I am now using and bought at Amazon called RAW meal replacement.  Much less expensive on Amazon and this is now my choice of for shakes.  Hope this helps.

2208,In the description it says each package contains one cup of raw product. Does that mean there is one cup of dehydrated veggies in each pouch?,yes that is what it had in my pouches
2209,What are the flavours?,"Lemon,rose and mint.Not sure about the mint but I think so. Plus it had pistachios."
2210,Why is your product description not telling us how many sachets in this box? I would like to know how many sachets I am getting from the box.,There is 20 sacks in a box
2211,Does Kirkland have a website?  I can't find anything on your company.,"Kirkland is Costco's house brand, so if you have a membership you can likely find any Kirkland product in the warehouse store or at Costco.com for significant savings (My membership pays for itself year after year!)"
2212,"How is the presentation?  Do they come stacked in plastic wrap, a box, etc.","They are wrapped in plastic in a stack of maybe 10.  Don't have them in front of me, so I don't remember the exact count."
2213,Does this item have the little noodles or the new big noodles?,Little noodles
2214,Is there anyway to store them for long periods if I am not making kefir on a daily basis?,I give my grains a break in a milk bath stored in the frig.
2215,Is it one can or two can??,2 cans
2216,"Is it very slippery, hard to control the size you want to stick with? Thanks!",No it stayed where I adjust it to. Your welcome. :)
2217,Do they need to be roasted before eating?,"You can roast them before eating but there is no need. To get the full antioxidant potential out of them they should be eaten raw. I throw them in the blender with chocolate yogurt, protein powder and a banana."
2218,Is this a GMO free product?,Annie Chun's website doesn't state if it is GMO free. Their seaweed snacks contain canola oil though and it is notorious for being genetically modified.
2219,"How does this compare to the ""ICE"" product?",It is not as sweet as Ice since it does not contain fruit juice.   This product is just lightly carbonated spring water and natural flavorings.
2220,Can I use these in a regular Kureg machine that takes k-cups,"No, lavazza machines only"
2221,Are these jugs BPA free?,No this is not a bpa free bottle
2222,are there artificial colors in these?,"The bag says, ""all natural flavors and colors"" If you want to call the company and ask what the source of the ""natural colors"" is: 888-375-6462. I have found them good to talk to. The suckers taste really good."
2223,I ferment things and of course have to feed the wild yeast. Do you know whether coconut crystals can be utilized by yeast like regular sugar can?,"I have never tried to use it with yeast, but I think it could work; I would recommend using hot enough water at first to ""melt"" the cyrstals then once the temp. is lukewarm, add the yeast.  Please let me know if it works for you."
2224,does it powder vegetables,it is a tomato pulper....it's function is to extract a puree from raw or blanched tomatoes.  I know of no device which powders vegetables.
2225,"What are the nutrition facts and serving size? Specifically Calories, Total fat, sodium, carbs, protein, potassium & cholesterol? (per serving)",I looked this stuff up a long time ago. I wanted a low carb cream powder for coffee which it was but I had trouble finding the calories which was what I cared about. I can't begin to find this stuff again but it was like 33calories a tablespoon and very little carbs- hope that helped a little
2226,Is it 6 packs each including 6 packets or its just 1 pack with 6 packets inside?,"It's a little box with 7 packets. By right if it's not sold by Starbucks, it's 7 packets. From Starbucks itself, 6 packets. I don't know why it is like that."
2227,I purchased this item back in August but the lid came loose in shipping.  Can anyone tell me if Amazon's packaging for this mayo has been more secure?,"i ordered 2 jars and they were fine. mine had a seal under the lid. . . .if yours didnt have a seal, i would return!"
2228,What are the Ingredients in this? Does anybody have a bag to look at? Thanks,"Starlight Mints - 7 lb bag by Bakers & Cheese - Serving size 3 mints = Calories 0%; Total Fat 0%; Cholestrol 0%; Sodium 0%; Total Carbs 15G 5%; Dietary Fiber 0%; Sugars 11g; Protein 0g, Vit A 0%; vIT c 0%; Calcium 0%; Iron 0%; Ingrediants - Glucose Syrup; Sugar; Natural & Artificial Flavor, Artificial Colors; Titanium Dioxide; Red 40 and Blue 1 (Contains traces of Soy) Note: Our choice of this product is due to the real Peppermint Flavor without overdue sweetness, which many similier product lack, beint too sweet and low in Peppermint Flavor. This is a really good Peppermint Flavored Product."
2229,i bought these products..very nice.  one problem the candy became hard 30mins after placing in bags. what may i be doing wrong?,Cotton Candy will harden when exposed to high humidity/heat.  You need to be careful to not crush it when you're spinning it on the stick.  It's a practice and art-form kind of thing sadly.  You can use plain sugar (no flavoring) as a cheap form of practice.
2230,Are these plastic or glass bottles?,Glass bottles. I order this frequently.
2231,"Is the bread mix produced in a gluten-free environment? Is it marked ""kosher"" with no ""d"" beside the mark?",Yes
2232,What is the expiration date on this?,"Sorry, I don't know, I usually don't keep it long enough to have it expire as fresh and drinkable.  In my humble opinion, Hires is the best and only root beer I buy and unfortunately it isn't sold at any store near me.  Amazon is the best place and shipping is usually free, to get it.  RC"
2233,"So for the $80, how much do you get? When I add it to my cart it comes to $81.35","I hope you have tried this ""cheese"" and I would suggest buying it from a regular grocery store....it's good and runs around five dollars per pack here in Atlanta...."
2234,Is any oil added to the unsalted dry roasted Virginia Peanuts or is it strictly just peanuts?,"These peanuts are just plain roasted, no oil, no salt."
2235,"I'm unclear on if this flour includes the inedible seed coat or it was ground without it,",It's just the edible part that is ground up.  The seed was hulled.
2236,"If im a beginner in upstate ny, is this a good choice? It gets cold here.","So far, it's lasted outside past few weeks in jersey in the cold no problem. It's a small worthy investment. Can't hurt to try it out. Do research on the specific species of the tree for the most accurate info."
2237,"There are no ingredients listed for this. Does it contain ""vegetable oil""? my daughter is allergic to corn!","Hello Evie:I copied and pasted ingredients info below from WOWBUTTER'S Website here: http://www.soybutter.com/docs/brochure.pdfINGREDIENTS: NON-GMO TOASTED SOY, SOY OIL, CANE SUGAR, MONOGLYCERIDE (FROM VEGETABLE OIL), SEA SALT.

2238,Do you know appx. how many pieces are in the bag?,About 140 pieces give or take.
2239,Is this flour gluten free?,"Yes, brown rice flour is a naturally gluten free flour. Even if you find wheat that is organic and sprouted, research has shown most do not react to the gluten because it is not like mass processed wheat flour. Hope this helps!"
2240,would this product work for Pad Thai?,"We have never used it for that recipe but these are very light weight in taste and work in many recipes including soups, sauces, mixed with vegetables, and more. My wife and grandkids love these noodles."
2241,Is this Bromated or not?,It says unbromated right in the product description.
2242,"The description says Organic, however one reviewer stated that they are not organic.  Can you tell me if these nuts are certified organic?  Thank you","Hi, I can only tell you that I'm satisfied with the product and have not verified any claims made by the company regarding the wether or not it's organic."
2243,Is this 100% PURE coconut palm sugar? Or has it been processed with white sugar?,"The 'only' ingredient in this product is 100% Certified Organic Coconut Nectar Sugar. It has a lower glycemic index than regular white sugar. Processed unbleached, unfiltered and no preservatives."
2244,"With all these conflicting reviews, I don't know if my grinder will work or not.  Some say no problem.  Some speak as if it is concrete.",It's just salt... There shouldn't be any problem with grinders unless they are cheap plastic grinding wheels. It's no harder than typical table salt
2245,"Does the cocoa have a kosher symbol? if so, which one?","If you cjeck the description of the chocolate, you will see that it is certified Kosher."
2246,Would this be considered paleo?,Yes they are considered ok as part of the paleo diet. I like the coconut wraps and other paleo products but I did not like these squares. And I love coconut.
2247,What phase is this good for?,Same as Charlise I have eaten these bars on all phases. The key is how your system reacts to the sugar alcohols. Some people have trouble with them from both digestion and blood sugar and if you do then the actual carbs might be too high for you. Go ahead and try some and weigh yourself daily to see if they're having a bad effect
2248,"I added the grain into 1 cup organic goat milk, waited for 24 hrs. it's still runny and not creamy at all. should i wait longer?","Did you just receive the grains or are they active grains? Usually it take a week or two after shipping before the grain becomes fully active. You need to follow the instruction that comes with the shipping. Also, what is the proportion of milk to grain? If you have too little grain, it will take longer time. I use whole cow milk, and about 1:4 ratio of grain vs milk, and it takes 24 hour in room temperature (70'F) to get good kefir. Hope this helps."
2249,"Is this product intended to taste ""green,"" or are there any other ingredients added for flavor?","This one tastes very green, no added flavors. I would describe it as earthy and I mix with plain water first thing in the morning and I enjoy the earthiness of it and there is no aftertaste. It would mix well with other things probably if you prefer since it has no flavor added."
2250,Do you use with boiling water or can you make with cold water?,I always make it with cold water
2251,Is it really organic/non Gmo,"BOB'S RED MILLCheck here for the FAQ - we may be able to answer your question now...General Product Questions:Are your products genetically modified?No. All of our products originate from identity-preserved, non-GMO seeds. This means that the seed planted in the ground is non-GMO. We do not guarantee the complete absence of GMO materials in our products because of wind drift, pollinators and our lack of testing equipment."
2252,Do you just put some of this in a salt shaker to use?,"We keep ours in a salt shaker, but add it to the butter/oil. It spreads evenly as the kernels pop."
2253,What is the carb count for Swerve?,"Although the package lists 5g = 5 g carbs, there are zero g sugar and the carbs pass through your system undigested, therefore the actual digested carbs are zero.. I believe Carolyn explains more on her blog of All Day I Dream About Food. SWERVE is also the recommended sweetener of Maria Emmerich, a nutritional counselor who also has a blog and several books. Both could give you better information on using SWERVE. I like that it substitutes in equal amounts for sugar in recipes and has a clear sweet taste with no digestive discomfort as is found with some sweeteners."
2254,How much oil does it take and can you reuse the oil? How do you dispose of the used oil?,"I usually purchase vegetable oil at Costco - sold in a package of 3 gallons.  It takes approx 2 gallons.  Yes you can reuse the oil for at least 2 more frys.  Keep in mind that you should be consistent when reusing the oil, I would not fry a turkey with oil that I previously fried fish with.  Draining the oil from this fryer is very easy, with a funnel you can ""drain"" the oil back into the original container.  I wait until the next morning insuring that oil has cooled down."
2255,is this curing salt number #1 or curing salt number #2,#1 has sodium nitrITE (ITE)#2 has sodium nitrATE (ATE)Please let me know if this helps.
2256,Is this a bulk package or individual packs?,"This is a bulk package, so you can make as much or as little as you want.  Very easy to make--you don't need to be a mathematician to figure out servings.  When you make them, the ratio of liquid to pearls is that you use twice as much liquid.  When I open them up I transfer them into a plastic container.  They keep really well so you don't have to worry about them going bad."
2257,Does this come in a glass or plastic jar?,Glass jar
2258,organic?,The package does not say organic.  It says  no transfat and no GMOs.  Don't know what GMOs are.  I bought 16 lbs not realizing how much that was. I keep it in the freezer and almost all of the kernels pop.  Its good popcorn.
2259,How many harvests are you guys getting?  I'm looking at this from an economic standpoint -- so is it cheaper than buying mushrooms at the grocers?,"I got two out of my box, but the second harvest was smaller than the first. It was also grown in a much drier location than the first, so I'm guessing that if we'd kept it in the wetter climate at our house, the second harvest might have been bigger."
2260,Does this tea contain caffeine?,No
2261,are there lime or sour apple skittles?,Are the green skittles lime or apple flavored???  What is the expiration date??
2262,Will this fit my 22 W x 12 D cabinet? How does it stay attached to the cabinet?,Absolutely no problem.  It's only 13 inches wide and 9 1/2 inches deep.  It comes with tape but we attached ours with screws that either came with it or we had on hand.  I love it and appreciate that I don't have to use up valuable counter space.  Enjoy!
2263,About how many cups do you get out of the 1 pound bag?  I'm trying to make cookies for a bake sale and want to order enough.,you probably have 4 or 5 cups.I would personally order from Honeyville grain directly from their website.  Their product is amazing and their 5lb bag is fairly priced at $44 if you are a baker or use almond flour for savory recipes.
2264,"Is the 'government' cheese?  My grandmother used to get government cheese, it was awesome.  Is this the same?","It's very BLAND due to the fact that it's not SHARP...I was in a bind and could not get to the store, so I ordered this cheese thinking it would be "" better than nothing "" ( I've never had govt. cheese, but I doubt whether it would be "" awesome "", if you found it to your liking, then you'll love this one ) totally lacking in any "" characteristics "" that would make a cheese interesting, I wasn't expecting much from a "" medium "" cheddar, so I wasn't very disappointed, it served it's purpose....never again, no fault of Tillamook.........for me, SHARP, or EXTRA SHARP is the only way to go.

   It's very BLAND due to the fact that it's not SHARP...I was in a bind and could not get to the store, so I ordered this cheese thinking it would be "" better than nothing "" ( I've never had govt. cheese, but I doubt whether it would be "" awesome "", if you found it to your liking, then you'll love this one ) totally lacking in any "" characteristics "" that would make a cheese interesting, I wasn't expecting much from a "" medium "" cheddar, so I wasn't very disappointed, it served it's purpose....never again, no fault of Tillamook.........for me, SHARP, or EXTRA SHARP is the only way to go.

2265,"I want dough for rolls & buns, and freeze the leftover dough. Is this the right type of yeast for freezing? THANK YOU!",Yes! Make sure to seal air tight after opening the container. I love this brand.
2266,how long does it cure or age,I think you'd have to ask Fortuna about that process; I was just the eater and the Sausage was edible immediately upon receipt as soon as I could get the pumpernickle
2267,Can you bake with this?,"? not sure, When I purchased it it was to put in my coffee."
2268,are these unsulfured?,I don't know but they were not good I threw them out
2269,What is in this product?,It has Carbalose flour. Its a enzyme enriched wheat flour. Soy fiber. Canola oil. Buttermilk powder baking powder egg white powder and is 2g net carbs. Its much like Bisquick if you've ever used that.
2270,I'm wondering if the glycerin in it is plant based or animal based?,"I'm really not sure about the glycerin.  I do know that I stopped using it as it just didn't seem ""right"" and tastes chemically to me.  Very disappointing.  I then boughtWildcrafted Vanilla Powder, 100% Pure Raw by Wilderness Poets This stuff is raw, pure, so fantastic I highly recommend.  You will not be disappointed. I'm now addicted to it and went back and bought 4 oz of it too just to make sure I don't run out.  Please give that a try."
2271,Could someone please reply with the list of ingredients? Thank you.,"ingredients: coconut oil, glucose solids, fructose, dextrose, sugar, modified milk ingredients, flavor (lipolyzed cream), salt tricalcium phosphate, mono and diglycerides, maltodextrin, sucralose, cocoa, dipotassium phosphate, sodium silico aluminate. contains 30 mg sucralose per 17 grams (235ml serving). contains: milk and soy"
2272,Does this accept standard Nitrous Chargers or do you have to buy the Molecule-r brand chargers?,Yes it does accept all chargers
2273,"Are these 3 x 1lbs bags, or 3 x 1/3 lbs bags? Description is confusing.","Yes I was confused too, it is 3 1lb bags"
2274,where do you source your buckwheats,My package says product of China.
2275,Is it produced by USA?,"The label says, ""USDA Organic,"" Lundberg Farms is in California, and the label also says it is ""Certified Organic by California Certified Organic Farmers CCOF,"" so I believe the answer to your question is ""YES""."
2276,I want to know for sure if this order will come with 12 cans or 6 cans - the description is confusing; but with the price I'm hoping its 12?,"It is confusing but it comes in 12, paying that much for only 6 would be absurd!"
2277,Can I use this in a pizza dough recipe for a bread machine?,"Absolutely! I use the dough cycle on my bread machine all the time with Caputo 00 flour. This is a 'wetter' dough than a normal pizza dough. It can be a bit sticky, but a floured surface and floured hands are all you need. Once you are used to working with this type of dough, it's no more difficult to use than any other flour. Keep in mind, however, unlike with many more forgiving recipes, bread and pizza dough (especially, this type) really need to use exact measurements and less guesswork (and a HOT oven). Here is a perfect recipe for pizza dough with Caputo 00 flour (make it by weight and, if possible, let it sit over night in the fridge. Or not!):    http://www.fornobravo.com/PDF/Using-caputo-tipo00.pdf I use the bread machine's dough cycle with this recipe and it is always perfect!

2279,Is this three bags of Maoams?,Yes! You're going to receive 3 bags of maoams :)

2284,Will this item be Prime eligible again?,The San Francisco organic biodegratable etc. is PRIME.  I just looked at it on amazon. Why is everyone saying shipping is not free.  Indeed it is.
2285,is it just virgin or extra virgin oil?,"Although it says ""Virgin"" on its label - there's really not a difference in the two.  The big difference is refined vs unrefined.  I've had both and absolutely prefer the unrefined oil.  Here's an excerpt from: http://www.livestrong.com/article/266229-what-is-the-difference-between-virgin-extra-virgin-coconut-oil:  ""Unlike olive oil - whose `extra virgin' label denotes a better quality product and commands a higher price - no such distinction exists in the coconut oil industry. The addition of an ""extra virgin"" label to coconut oil remains a marketing gimmick, rather than an indication of the oil quality.""  I hope this helps.

2290,Why did Amazon stop selling this directly and make it ineligible for Prime?,"Good Morning,My name is Mayra Flores, an employee at Rogers Family Coffee Company, the manufacturer for these San Francisco Bay products. In response to your inquiry, the current issue is caused because this product that is sold by and shipped by Amazon is out of stock. Our San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser 80ct is not being offered for Prime shipping by Amazon at the moment because Amazon is out of stock on this product and the system defaults to a third party seller and higher price. Therefore while Amazon is out of stock, the only way to buy this product on Amazon is through a third party reseller and this why Amazon customers come across the issue of higher prices. For future reference when buying our products through Amazon, be careful that it is not through a third party seller. You can look for the tag that says ""sold and shipped by Amazon"". A third party seller will have a different sold by name and the price will probably be higher. I would advise that you check back on Amazon in a day or two to see if this product is back in stock.

2291,Does this product contain any dairy products and can it be used as a powder in bread recipes,"Hi, It does contain casein, which is derived from milk.  I am not sure how much casein is in there.  You could ask the manufacturer.  I have not cooked with it.  I use it to make powdered coffee creamer and it works fine for that.  It is a fine powder that dissolves relatively easily.  I will continue to order it.  I hope my answer helps you."
2292,Is there any calories in this coffee?,Like most coffees this one does not contain any calories unless you add extras.
2293,"On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the spiciest), how spicy is this?",I would say an 8. It is spicy but not very very spicy. Its nacho. So if you had nachos at a game or anything I'd compare it to that.
2294,are these certified kosher?,I don't know.  Sorry I can't be of help.
2295,is the kit good,The kit is fun to make bit tastes like wet stale bread.
2296,Can you substitute espresso ground coffee for espresso powder in a cake recipe?,I would not....  If you do not have the option of getting espresso powder I would grind up the espresso coffee really really really fine....   I love cooking with ground espresso it's a staple in my home
2297,what is the volume of this container?,It is really good and it has 30 sachets in a box
2298,Is this a plastic or glass container?,It's plastic.
2299,About many coins are in this package?,"Unfortunately, I only read the comment about having 102 pieces in this package, so I only ordered 1.  My 1 lb order actually only had 62 pieces!"
2300,What is the calorie count per serving?,25
2301,Do you ship to saudi arabia?,"Yup, but delivery time should take about 20-35 days for your location."
2302,"Is this pure buttermilk - any additives, preservatives, dyes, etc.","There are no artificial ingredients at all, just buttermilk solids and whey."
2303,What is the maximum cooking and baking heat with this coconut oil?,"I haven't baked with coconut oil; I've fried eggs, and they are delicious.  I've also fried veggies battered in egg and almond flour.  I highly recommend!  I've read that refined coconut oil tolerates heat differently than unrefined coconut oil."
2304,"Does this product contain sugars, cane syrups, etc?  Is the ""honey""natural honey or a honey and sugar combination?","The package lists ""Refinery syrup"", (which is actually high fructose corn syrup) as the first ingrdient. All powderd, granulated, honey crystal products on the market are basically dried corn syrup with only 5 to 7 % honey."
2305,What expiration date is listed on the package?,No expiration date listed
2306,"What is the acidity of this coffee, light, medium, or strong?","Hi Fiona, Thanks for asking. The Fool's Ethiopian Harrar is a light roasted bean and the acidity is low. All the Coffee Fool Beans is high grade 100% Arabica beans and they always give a great cup. If you are use to drink a darker roasted bean you will more than likely need one of our darker roast - like the Fool's House Italian. Dark and smooth but never bitter. We roast all our coffees much lighter than the big companies out there. Thanks, Coffee Fool Natalie"
2307,Dimensions? How many gallons does it fill? Thank you,"I was lucky and found old glass gallon pickle jars at my mom and dad's house. The fifty pound bag of steel cut oats will require eight of the one gallon jars to hold them all. You definitely don't want any insects getting to your oats. I would suggest not storing them in a hot room, either. I am on my last jar and will be ordering more soon. My last order was in October of 2013. I consumed all of them by myself, for breakfast. They still are just as good as when I received them."
2308,Is this 100% pure Ceylon?,That's what the label reads. This seems to help with glucose levels better that the cassia products.
2309,"Where can I find nutritional information for your powdered butter ie. fat content, etc.?","Serving size: 3 tbspTotal fat 14g--22% DVSaturated fat 9g--45% DVTrans fat 0gCholesterol 40mg--13% DVSodium 170mg--7% DVTotal carbohydrate 3g--1% DVDietary fiber 0gSugars 3gProtein 2gCalories per gram:  fat 9, carbohydrates 4, protein 4ALLERGEN INFORMATION:  Contains milk. This product is produced on equipment that processes products containing Soy, Wheat, Egg, Peanut, and Tree Nuts."
2310,Is the label green because it is made especially for Keurig,Not tht I know of? I am thinking that this is an older picture
2311,What harvest (year) is this from?,"On my TJs EVOO bottle: check on the lower part of the glass, right above the base (below label, under UPC barcode), there are lightly printed numbers & exp date. Extremely tiny print & may have rubbed off easily. You can probably call Trader Joes w/ this quality control number & exp date to find out the harvest date."
2312,Are these nuts dry roasted?,"Yes they are. We have been very pleased with them, because we wanted the dry roasted, unsalted.  Very good."
2313,Are there specific directions for noodles that only have stove-top directions (e.g. boil 3 minutes)?,"I break my instant noodles into 4 pieces. Then thow them in, add a bottle of water and nuke it for 2:30mins at high, bring it out, mix the noddles around and put it back in for another 2 mins without lid this time (or else it gets bubbles raising). I love it, it's great for soup, it won't spill"
2314,"what are the nutrition facts in these muffins- calories, fat, sugar, salt",go to      https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31284252/FactSheet_06-07-2013/77401.pdf    has complete nutrition. Hope that helps.
2315,Do these fit directly into the K75? I bought some others that do not.,I am using the original and they fit directly.
2316,is this the same as nattokinase? and non-gmo?,"Nattokinase is a particular protein that is found in natto, specifically in the Bacillus subtilis bacteria that ferments the soy beans, changing them into natto! So if you eat natto then you are also consuming the nattokinase. I would guess that it is non-gmo because the Japanese have a very strict policy, currently, on gmo-food products. I would caution however that this version of natto is very very strong. It takes a little getting used to, however if you can get your hands on some fresh natto or ferment your own that would be the best in my opinion."
2317,"what is the shelf life, unopened and open","My church encourages food storage for emergencies (loss of job, natural disasters, etc) and their website says that although nutrients do decrease a bit over time, wheat can store for 30+ years and ""will help sustain life in an emergency.""  www.lds.org/topics/food-storage/longer-term-food-supply  That said, on another website called provident living, wheat was given a shelf life of 15 years when stored at ""room temperature"" which is still pretty great.  In my experience, after opening my wheat, I still keep it in a bucket with a gamma lid and I have never noticed a decline in the quality in the time that I have used it (over 2-3 years).  I do wait to grind it until I'm going to use it, because the nutrients do decrease rather quickly after grinding it.  Sometimes I'll store freshly ground wheat flour in the freezer to preserve the nutrients longer.  Hope that helps!

2319,How many ounces are in this can?,"The tin I have is 900 grams.  If I remember my high school math well enough (1000 gram = 2.2 pounds), they are about 31.5 ounces, about 2 pounds.  They are heavenly, addicting."
2320,How much gum is actually in the package?,A serving is 2 pieces which the package says is 2.8g.  Total weight is 80 g(or 2.82 ounces per the package).  Divide 80 grams by 2.8 grams(a serving) and you get an answer of 28.3687943 total servings; so that would be 56.7 pieces!

They do ""melt"" in their mouths, but until he's really good at eating chunkier purees and starts some solids I'd hold off on these.  Their fine motor skills aren't developed enough yet to have the coordination to pick it up and put it in their mouth.  I've always started with organic baby mum mums (rice rusk).  It's large enough for them to hold and it melts faster than the puffs do."
2327,"So the picture on this listing is accurate and that is the color of the ""Jet Black"" cocoa?  It looks more like a sudan dutch to me.","Hi! I'm a frequent buyer of black cocoa (Blommer, King Arthur, Jellybean, Frontier, et al) and I can tell you that the thumbnail image on this page is indeed inaccurate. The ""Jet Black"" cocoa sold here by Blommer is definitely black due to intensified Dutching. Ignore that little picture and enjoy your black brownies in peace! :-)"

They come from a region of Japan far away from ground zero. They are from Kagoshima, which is as far west from Fukushima as Denver is from New York.

2357,"is this Dutch processed at all, or alkalinized?","The package describes it as certified organic, non GMO, raw, vegan, made from premium Criollo cacao beans from Ecuador with minimal low-temperature processing and with no sugars or fillers.  There would have to be some sort of processing involved in making cacao beans into cacao powder. Alkalinizing--I don't know, but it doesn't seem so. What I do know is that this is really good stuff!"
2358,Could you tell me what country of origin?,The chestnuts are product of China.
2359,Are they easy to separate from the roll and open at the top?,Yes there is an opening in both of the two bone shaped carriers. They are easy to tear off. I never review amazon products but I am very satisfied with these and have never had one with a hole in them.
2360,"Why does this product come up first when doing a search for ""organic food coloring?""  I can find nothing here that says it's organic.","Also. I am looking for organic coloring....not red dye #40...So, yes this makes no sense for being organic."

You use both products equally as far as amounts go.

Here's from the company's website: http://www.bernardjensen.com/7-oz-GELATIN-POWDER--100-BOVINE_p_49.html.  Following the cycle of the seasons, a ruminant will pick up grain as it finishes in the fields and pastures nearing fall.  Its not something that bothers me but some people do require a grain free diet."

Rice Bran Oil is also sometimes called Grilling Oil because of its wonderful high-heat capabilities. It could just as easily be called Salad Oil, Baking Oil, etc...  Just another way to describe it.  But it is 100% Pure Rice Bran Oil.  Thanks!"

I have something like 17 Irish Breakfast Teas, all in bags, because... well, I'm too old and too lazy to fiddle with washing those little metal ball things.Twining's was, typically, my first IBT. Punjana my second, Barry's my third.  ALL were excellent, but Bewley's Dublin Morning AND Bewley's IBT are superior, IMO. You didn't ask, but Taylor's of Harrogate beats them all, and Whittard's is top-notch also. Props to Trader Joe's for always being there when I want it, which isn't all that often. Republic of Tea's Pot of Gold Lucky Irish Tea, despite the verbiage, is great as well.Why not try them all?  Bet you will buy them all again when you're out.  I can't get enough of IBTs.

It is pretty finely ground in the package (unless you buy the stick cinnamon) and blends into baking recipes or as my husband uses it, in his hot tea. For the hot cinnamon tea he just puts the cinnamon in with his tea bag by removing the bags staple, put about 1/8 teaspoon in and re-staple the bag. I've used it to make frosting for cinnamon rolls, yummy...:>)))."

2433,are these markers American made?,"Good question. It does not state if made in the U.S. It does say U.S. certified food color. It gives a website of americolorcorp.com However, the markers do not work after  3 uses. The color begins to fade. I would not recommend this product at all. It is a waste of money. I hope this helps."

(I am the only person who likes coffee in my household.),"I'm the only person that drinks mine too.  :)I buy the 6-pack to save on shipping and freeze the ones that are not in use.  This past winter, the last bottle of a pack had been in the freezer for about 4 months.  Thawed out, it tasted fine, though strangely, it's a little stronger.  So I just use a tad less.  I think the longest I have had one sit in the fridge (not freezer) has been maybe 2 months.  Tasted fine to me down the last drop.  Also to note, I use mine only for iced coffee and go heavy on the milk, so that might be covering up any differences in the taste of the coffee itself over time.If I were you I'd just get the single bottle first and try it out.  If you like it, join the club!  If not, then you're only out the twenty bucks or so.

He recommended Grade B syrup because he assumed, probably due to its dark color and intense flavor, that it was less refined than other maple syrups. However, NO pure maple syrup is refined in any way whatsoever. ALL pure maple syrup contains many beneficial nutrients, including minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and iron. Traditionally, maple syrup is considered to be good for digestion and the circulatory system. It has fewer calories most other sweeteners and contains no fat at all.""

There are other sourdough starter strains which are marketed under the San Francisco name. You might ask, ""Are all sourdough starters the same""? Probably not. I'm sure there are variations in the wild yeasts and bacteria between various strains which may affect leavening periods and perhaps taste of the baked goods to some extent. But all sourdough starter strains do the same job. They leaven baked goods. San Francisco sour dough bread gets its distinctive flavor and texture from how it is prepared for baking. I have little doubt that the Breadtopia sourdough strain (which I have) can be used to make San Francisco style sourdough bread. I haven't tried that yet, however. If you are looking for ""authentic"" San Francisco starter, though, you can always buy other brands of sourdough starters that are marketed under the San Francisco label. It appears that Amazon.com carries some of them.

2487,Does this product have Carageenan?  It doesn't list on the ingredient list.,Carageenan is the 7th listed ingredient.
2488,Is it made with carrageen?,Carrageenan IS listed in the ingredients.  It must be bad if you're asking.  Please elaborate.
2489,Is this 100% oil?,"The ingredient list includes water, propylene glycol, natural flavor, acacia gun, xanthan gum, and sodium benzocaine in that order."
2490,Can activated barley be added to hot cereal?,"Well, yes it could but if the temperature of said cereal is 118 degrees or above it will degrade some of the effects.  At 118 degrees enzymes breakdown and at higher temperatures other nutrients are destroyed or change shape at a molecular level making them harder for your body to assimilate them.  For optimum results mix this with raw food... if added to cooked food  add once the temp drops below 118... this will still have some value when the enzymes are destroyed but not as much."

2500,Is this product capsules or herbal tablets?,"Hallo, it's capsules."
2501,is this whole weat,"No.  This is not whole wheat.  The other answers are just wrong.  Read the labels.However this not 100% refined either.  It has 20% of the bran left in the flour.  Great River Milling calls it ""light whole wheat"".  So if you expect bread to rise like the regular refined flour, you will need some adjustment.  This is the reason some people complain about it."
2502,what is difference between this drink and coconut water....does label show how much sugar,"Only 2 ingredients: natural coconut water and pulp. 14 g of natural sugars. I love this stuff and the pricing is right. 60 calories per serving (2 in a can) 78 mg sodium per serving. Potassium isn't listed, but coconut juice usually has 2-300 mg potassium. This drink satisfies a desire for sweetness, though it doesn't taste very sweet. Highly recommended and more flavorful that most coconut waters."
2503,How much sodium per serving and what is the serving size?,right from the package my good friend: sodium 150 mg (6% mdr) serving size 28 grams (about 11 chips)!!! In my opinion best tortilla chips on the market bar none; and healthiest as well!!! No I don't work for their company!!!
2504,What orchard in Michigan are these cherries grown. I have heard that the FDA has been sending warning letters about false health claims.,"I purchased the TCJC from various manufacturers after reading many articles and reviews on the benefits of tart cherrys.

Using the concentrates are easier than eating a ton of real cherries. I did research FDA warnings to a particular companies about using incorrect wording on their website. It was not directed towards the benefits of Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate in general. "" Here is a link :http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2012/ucm307676.htm... And that was in 2012. There is another article from 2006. I think for $15.00 for a 160z bottle from Amazon or local vitamin store or vitaminshoppe online, you can test it for yourself. There are many many comments posted on Amazon and other places about whether they benefited from drinking TCJC. I can tell you it did help me. What has helped prob the most though is taking this and doing stretches on the areas I have problems with. ie the space between my thumb and forefinger and hand in general. Stretching helped tremendously while taking the cherry juice. I will not stop doing either one. Why tamper with good results.

2508,How many Tablespoons or Cups are in 16 oz (1 lb) of sprinkles?,"It's not an apples to apples comparison since one is a measure of weight/mass and the other is volume. However, I weighed a 1/3 cup of sprinkles and it was 2.5 ounces. Hope that helps."
2509,Does this have caffeine in it?,Chamomile normally do not contain caffeine so if it is pure 100% chamomile I would think not.
2510,does this containcaffein,"I am not seeing it on the box or in the ingredients.  It does contain milk, soy and tree nuts. It has cocoa powder. That might naturally have caffeine but not positive."
2511,are the ingredients GMO?,"As of October 2013, all cocoa plants are produced without genetic modification (http://truth-out.org/news/item/15323-the-future-of-chocolate). This could change in the future, of course, but for now the cocoa itself in chocolate bars is safe (but for peace of mind you may want to buy ethically grown and organic cocoa products). The other ingredients in most chocolate bars, however, may be GMO (and probably are if they contain sugar, soy lecithin and/or dairy). This product is not organic but it also does not have any of the ingredients that are most likely GMO, so it is safe. The top most likely GMO ingredients include - soy, sugar beets (if a label says ""sugar"" but not ""cane sugar"" it is probably made from sugar beets and GMO), corn, canola, alfalfa and papaya. These ingredients are in most of our processed foods, are fed to all of our factory farm raised animals. If you buy non-organic food, and animal products not from grass fed, free range, humanely raised animals, beware! GMOs are in your diet and you are part of a big science experiment without your consent. I believe our food should be labeled if there are GMO ingredients so that we can choose whether or not we want to be subjected to ""frankenfood"".

2512,how many pieces are their?,"10 packs, 10 pieces in each.  That makes 100 pieces in total, 20 pieces of each flavor"
2513,what causes sensor to malfunction?,"I have not seen the sensor malfunction per say. I have had issues with people not knowing exactly where the sensor is and being caught off guard when candy is dispensed. Also the serving amount of small candy such as skittles can be quite large in all three settings, also catching people off guard."
2514,"The picture on the bottle is not Ceylon Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), but the cheaper and more common Cinnamomum Cassia. Is the variety stated?","Frontier offers several selections of cinnamon, so this is a good question.  I pulled my jar from the cupboard and the only ingredient listed on the bottle is certified organic Ceylon Cinnamon.  I love the taste and use it daily, either in a drink with green tea and lemon, or my morning organic oatmeal.  I'm not sure why the company used that picture on the bottle, but what's inside is Ceylon Cinnamon.  Enjoy!"
2515,About how many are in 1/2 pound? Thanks.,"I didn't count them, but I'd say at least 40-50. I made three 250 ml. bottles of extract, using 5 beans per, and gave 15 away and still have about 1/3 of the package left."
2516,Is it  vegetarian and  Gluten free?,"They are Halal and vegetarian, but not sure if gluten free."
2517,how many buzz buttons do you get for $46.83? 120?,I'm not 100% but there was a lot of them...
2518,Is it sticky if spilled on the rug?,It is not sticky if you spill it. It is the same as spilling flat water because it does not contain sweeteners.
2519,is this English Breakfast?,"This is a South African tea blend.  It's a strong black tea, good for breakfast.  It is similar in taste to an English Breakfast or Irish Breakfast tea."
2520,Is there any difference bewteen this tea and the Yamamotoyama Green Tea (Sushi Bar Style) 90 Bag Value Pack?,"sushi bar style has green tea powder in. more green color. but i like this tea more. i get clean feeling whole mouth after drink this tea more. do not use boiled water and dont leave tea bag in cup. it makes bitter. put little less hot water (just before boil), the taste become mild. hope this help"
2521,how big is the container,"It's 6 oz.  It's comparative in size to Cajun/creole seasonings in stores.  For a visual it is larger than a Clabber Girl Baking powder container.  If that helps.  There are many servings in the container.  I'm not sure what the Amazon price, it is $5 on the Duck Commander store."
2522,are there bones and skin in these tins of salmon?,No bones or skin. I would still check for stray pin bones before serving/eating. Very high quality product.
2523,will it help my hair grow,"As much as any other food helps your body do stuff, sure. If someone led you to believe you can eat something and it will make your hair grow faster, you can put some of this oil on your hand before you slap them."
2524,"Is this product gluten free and if so, why isn't it advertised that way?","The Essential Depot website says this in their product description:  ""You can use it ...  in the formation of various gluten free low-calorie foods.""  So, on their website, THEY say it IS gluten-free."
2525,Does this water have floride in it?,No...
2526,Does anyone know if there is sugar or sweetener of any sort in this? Thanks in advance.,"Jennifer, I just checked my jar ( I buy the low sodium type ) and organic cane sugar is #5 in the ingredients, just above chicken stock, just below chicken stock.  Hope you're well."
2527,Is this the same as the product the one Costco sold?,"Yes, it is. My problem has been finding it at Costco."
2528,"Which tastes better, the plain or the chocolate?  Thanks!",I think they both taste good...but I definitely prefer the chocolate. You can never go wrong with chocolate lol!
2529,Can this flour be used for making other than pizzas?  Bread or scones for example; maybe adding it to a bread recipe along with the bread flour?,"Yes.  It makes wonderful bread.  I also have found it to be superior to other flours for making ravioli or Chinese dumplings.  It has lots of gluten and therefore makes a dough with a lot of tensile strength.  This means I can roll pasta or wonton dough down to the thinnest setting and form the filled dumplings of whatever ethnic persuasion without worrying about ripping the dough.It has a great flavor for basic flour-water-salt-yeast bread.  I still use cheap AP or bread flour for when the flavor or gluten of the flour doesn't matter much, e.g. in dense multi-grain breads, gravy thickening, etc.  -- or when you really don't want much gluten as in muffins, biscuits, etc.

2530,Will these work in the Keurig 2.0?,Yes
2531,What are all the ingredients listed for this product?,"Hi Mike, Here is your answer and maybe more than you asked for but hope is helpful...I find more info is usually much better than too little!...Two ingredients:  Erythritol & Luo Han Guo (Monk Fruit) Both are zero on glycemic index.Luo Han Guo (Monk Fruit) tastes much more like sugar whereas Stevia an herb (Rebiana leaves,a chrysanthemum relative) has just a little bit of an aftertaste.Erythritol, a type of sugar alcohol, is absorbed into your blood stream, but does not readily enter any of your body's cells and is usually excreted through your urine. It does not tend to cause gastric distress like Sorbitol, Xylitol or particularly Malitol.I like to mix the ratio of 2 parts Demerara Sugar, 1 part Great Value Zero calorie sweetener (Erythritol & Stevia),& 1 part Lakanto. Excellent combination of taste and very little real sugar. Saves money using some Stevia (the Lakanto is quite expensive but great stuff).Stevia in the Raw brand is more expensive than the Great Value.Also it has Dextrose and Maltodextrin listed in the ingredients. Bad stuff.Dextrose is simply a form of glucose.Maltodextrin is a GMO corn derivative with an extremely high glycemic index of 150produced from rice, potato or corn starch. It is known to contain MSG and it doesn't need to state that on the ingredient label.Monk Fruit in the Raw also has either Dextrose or Maltodextrin or both.Both Stevia in the Raw and Monkfruit in the Raw on the box make it seem as if they do not contain other stuff, but on the product label and packets, it shows the bad stuff.

2532,whats the expiration date on these?,"Currently I do not have a jar to check, but when I last ordered it, the expiration date was well beyond the date I received it. It is delicious and I intend on ordering some more soon. Jane"
2533,butter Is the butter 100% grass-fed?,"This actually is NOT 100% grass-fed.  Their website states: Pasture Raised with Love! In a way cows are like kids - the more time outside the better. Our farmers send their cows out into lush, organic pastures for fresh air, exercise and grazing (weather permitting of course). Our Pasture-Raised™ animals receive the majority of their nutrition from organically managed pastures and stored dried grasses/forages. To ensure they get the complete nutrition they need, our cows may also be fed supplemental organic grains, both during the grazing season and into winter months.  Supplemental organic grains can include any of the following: corn, soy, oats, barley, triticale and other small grains. Animals also receive necessary mineral supplements that sometimes include non-iodized salt.

2534,Gluten free?,"The product labeling does not state gluten free however the ingredients do not show any wheat, barley or rye and it does state allergy free. I suggest writing to the manufacturer if there is any doubt and someone has a gluten allergy."
2535,"Can you freeze the leftovers?  For example, cooked meatloaf?","Most definitely. You can freeze left overs, and thaw them out with no problems. I have done that many times already. I am the only vegan here so sometimes I freeze foods I prepare so that I don't end up eating the same meal several days in a row."
2536,"What's the real quantity on these? 4x7, or just 4? Amazon claims these are $11 apiece -- if so, and that's daily, that seems remarkably high.","The attune box contains 7 bars (1 box/week). I have not purchased from this vendor, but I remember paying around $12/box of 7. This indicates that ""per item"" is ""per box of 7"" in this case. I cannot verify this however, maybe someone who purchased more recently can?"
2537,"I noticed that this is only QAI Organic, and not USDA Organic, does it really make a difference?",A. QAI is a USDA-accredited certifying agency. The USDA National Organic Program directly oversees all USDA certifying agents by conducting surveillance of products on the shelf that containing organic labels and conducting unannounced inspections at certifying agents' places of business. These steps ensure that QAI and all certifying agencies are following the strictest guidelines and best practices under the National Organic Program. -source- http://www.qai-inc.com/what_is_organic/organic_associations.asp

2539,"Discontinuation Godiva discontinued their sugar free line, how old is this candy bar?",Godiva brought them back on 2011 after customers complained about them being gone.  They're available at some boutiques and here on Amazon.
2540,Is this an actual yeast? Can I use this in place of yeast for my baking?,"It is definitely NOT yeast, it's a baking powder-type product that I have used in cakes and quickbreads, such as cornbread, but definitely not for yeast bread applications."
2541,How much sugar?,"11 grams per serving, 33 grams per bar."
2542,first harvest ?,"Don't know - but it IS very bright green with a ""fresh"" green flavor - much nicer than any other I've purchased, not ""gritty"" or ""chalky"".  Pure Matcha does make an Organic green matcha that is described as first harvest, but costs twice as much.  I've never tried it since this one is very good - hope this helps."
2543,Do you rinse the brine off before cooking? Thanks,I didn't and it turned out great !
2544,What are the ingredients?,"Triple filtered purified water, defatted cocoa powder, caramel color, natural flavors, vegetable fiber, sucralose, sea salt, vanilla flavor, lactic acid, xantham gum, sodium benzoate (to preserve freshness)"
2545,Are the cinnamon baking chips made in a peanut-fee facility?,I know they're soy based they did not comment as to possible other allergens.
2546,How many coins are in each pouch?,Five coins of varying sizes. We buy these coins because of my son's nut allergies. He really enjoys them!
2547,does this have to be stirred everytime I use to because the oil separates?,"Yes, but you can reduce the degree of separation by storing it in the refrigerator, or upside down (just make sure the lid is screwed on tightly)."
2548,can miracle noodles be frozen?,The package says Do Not Freeze.
2549,what is the size?,They are probably a little smaller than an actual bee? I didn't measure them. I used them for beehive cupcakes and a beehive cake and they were perfect.
2550,how to make this sushi,The instructions on the back are all in Japanese but there are plenty videos on youtube that show you how to make them > http://youtu.be/JWf3q4fGKK4
2551,GLUTEN FREE?,"Yes, nuts are naturally gluten free. However, some facilities process gluten containing grains (e.g. wheat, barley) on shared equipment -or- they can be contaminated during the harvesting & transport. Finding certified gluten free products is the only way to know that the end product contains less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten (considered safe enough for Celiacs). It would be great to hear back from Braga Organic Farms about how these items are harvested/transported and packaged."
2552,how long do I marinade meat,"I have marinaded it a few ways, from a few hours to almost 24hours, either way is good. Always got good reviews"
2553,How would you make smoothies out of this?,"All I do is put it in my blender with my banana, almond milk, ice, protein (optional) and the powdered peanutbutter... Less calories than actual peanutbutter but same great taste!"
2554,What do they eat,"""Venus Fly Traps will eat any kind of insect, but only insects. Do not try to feed them human food like chicken, beef, pork, doritos, avocado or anything else. Insects are the only thing on the menu for Venus fly traps.""  See FlyTrapCare.com for more info."

2556,Gluten-free? dairy-free (including equipment used for its processing)?,"The ingredients are: ""Brown rice syrup solids, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, vanilla. Contains: soy. Due to shared equipment, product contains traces of milk."" So, no not completely dairy-free due to equipment. But, I think they are gluten-free (but I'm not 100% positive). You'd have to contact SunSpire to find out for sure. http://www.sunspire.com/contact"
2557,How much popcorn does the Snappy Popcorn 47E Open-Top Popcorn Box hold?,Probably about 2-3 cups.
2558,Hi be nice for a quick reply. Im in the US would they be here quick? and would they be here like really quick?,"HelloThank you for your email, All of our orders are shipped with Royal Mail Airmail Standard which is a non-tracked service and delivered in 7-14 working days from shipment.Many thanksGemma"
2559,"Does this taste like the Paradise Tropical Tea Passion Fruit?  I used to drink that all the time, but they stopped making it.","We've never tried Paradise Tropical, but this one *is* tasty. We mix it 50/50 with Lipton and it has the perfect hint of Passion Fruit."
2560,is this a good price for pectin? Or is it cheaper if i buy it in a grocery store?,"This is a bargain. First, most stores in my area don't carry bulk pectin. The few ""specialty"" gourmet stores that do, charge double or more per jar than on Amazon. My groceries only sell pectin by the box and they cost about $3-$4 per box. One box makes about 6 pints. One jar like this makes 22 pints and also gives me the flexibility to make as low as one or two pints or all 22 if I choose, depending on what I'm canning. I buy this because it saves me a bundle and reduces waste at the same time. $4 for 6 pints or $7 for 22 pints. Just do the math. I love it."
2561,where is the crawfish from?,Mine spoke fluent Chinese. Not Creole. Very good though!
2562,Is it good for old people?,As grandparents of a handicapped child...we can assure you we are all using it in cooking and hot chocolate etc...and are very happy with the product...
2563,Is this flaxmeal gluten-free? The label shown does not have the GF symbol.,"Yes, Bob's Red Mill flaxseed meal is gluten free."
2564,Is this sweet rice the same as mochi?  Thank you.,"Yes, it is similar to mochi rice, but the grind is not as dusty fine as the Asian type.  I can still use them for different types of rice cakes, including mochi."
2565,"Can anyone verify if product is made China, I do not purchase food  products mfg. in China","The factory was started in Redding, California but is now located in Orgegon. As far as this food being produced or manfactured in China you will probably have to visit the site and contact them. The website is www.bobsredmill.com"
2566,How much oil does it take and can you reuse the oil? How do you dispose of the used oil?,"I usually purchase vegetable oil at Costco - sold in a package of 3 gallons.  It takes approx 2 gallons.  Yes you can reuse the oil for at least 2 more frys.  Keep in mind that you should be consistent when reusing the oil, I would not fry a turkey with oil that I previously fried fish with.  Draining the oil from this fryer is very easy, with a funnel you can ""drain"" the oil back into the original container.  I wait until the next morning insuring that oil has cooled down."
2567,Can I use these sugar sheets with an edible ink printer?,"Yes, I did it..and it worked beautifully :)"
2568,How many calories and carbs are in this thing?,"According to the packaging, there are 120 calories per serving and 51 servings in total.  So total calories for the 4 lb 8 oz bear is 6120.   As for carbs - it says 29 grams or 10% of Daily Value.  Hope this helps."
2569,"Do these require refrigeration, either before or after opening (if all of them are not used at the same meal, but not yet rehydrated)?","No!! They are fully dried and do not need refrigeration, at any time while they are in the dry state. Once you add water and re-hydrating them yes they need to be refrigeration."
2570,Can I get the complete nutritional details on the back of the bag?,No way Costco has a 3-1/2 lb bag for 6.29.  Impossible.
2571,does it kill grass?,"Yes, make sure to use on a hot day, direct sunlight helps. Grass is more resistant to vinegar than some weeds and may require multiple treatments.  I was able to kill some grass with the first application, but only if I mowed it first.  The first application will cause it to die back regardless, but for permanent removal apply at least twice."
2572,Are these the bite size or the 8 inch,bite size.
2573,is it made with sorbital,"package says ""sucralose (splenda brand)"""
2574,"i received this fast, but on bottles there are no labels?is it okay to use>>????????","What such a weird mistake! What kind of company is this! Are you sure it's black seed inside?

2575,how healthy is it,"Well, it is loaded with sugar... which goes a long way to making it so much more delicious than its unsweetened competitors. That being said, coconut water is great for hydration, rich in potassium and, according to medical blogs, filled with electrolytes. This is NOT a low calorie drink ( I think they even write that on the can.) But as a fellow who needs to maintain high fluid intake, there's nothing out there that I enjoy more."
2576,Ingredients list in English please :),"I am extremely allergic to Dairy and Guar Gum along with many more things. And this is the only coconut milk I can find that doesn't have a lot of added preservatives.  It is 100% coconut milk with nothing else, so you should be aware that the box states to discard after two days but I have used it up to a week with strict refrigeration after opening."
2577,"In the Masseo website they list the 7's Chicken flavor bullion cubes as having dehydrated parsley only, with no garlic or onion listed. Is this true?","Yes.  No onion or garlic, suitable for low FODMAP diets."
2578,What are the ingredients?,"Sugar, water, fructose, cocoa, natural flavor, unsweetened chocolate, potassium sorbate, salt, soy lecithin."
2579,are they organic?,"Kelp grows in the ocean, so they would not be classified as ""organic"" because that relates to farming without chemicals or GMO seeds.  These Kelp Noodles are made from sea kelp, water, and sodium alginate which comes from brown seaweed.  And... that is all.  We love them and use them a lot.  We got into the subscription plan so we never will run out."

2581,"is this $8.97 for ONE box?  The title says ""3 boxes"", but there are no details of how many boxes are included in this price.  Please respond!",There are 3 boxes in the shipment.  Each box contains 5 packages with 4 cookies in each pack.  This is cheaper than the grocery store.
2582,Is the plastic container BPA Free?,"I don't think that I came across a definitive answer... The bottom of the Kelap Coconut Oil carries the PETE 1 symbol.  The following information came from www.nrdc.org/thisgreenlife: ""#1 (PET or PETE) plastic is the kind used for bottled water bottles, which are generally regarded as safe.

I put some on a cracker and after I ate the 3rd cracker, my tongue swelled to the point where I couldn't close my mouth, when my throat and face started to swell, I had to be rushed to put ER. I brought the jar with me. I had to be admitted and given several med's through an IV drip.

She believes somehow hazelnut got cross contaminated with the sunflower/sesame butter. She said if the butter had contained any Hazelnut, I probably wouldn't be alive today.

It does say on the package that the only allergen it contains are cashews so if you're not allergic to cashews, you shouldn't have a problem. Hope this was helpful.

2680,I've always recieved mixed answers on whether buckwheat (like this item) is gluten free or not?  Please let me know which is correct for this item.,"Everything I read says ...yes, it is gluten free. But that only depends upon the facility if is processed in, if they also handle wheat productsHere us a snippet from Celiac.com.Celiac.com 10/18/2013 - Buckwheat, sometimes referred to as kasha, is often billed as a ""tasty alternative to wheat."" That's all well and good, but is it really gluten-free, and generally considered safe to eat for those who suffer from celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity?  The FactsGood news! With its non-wheat status, buckwheat is safely gluten-free. Buckwheat and wheat are, come to find out, actually from completely different botanical families. Derived from the seeds of a flowering plant, buckwheat is not considered a grain or a cereal (though it may be called a pseudo-cereal-don't let that scare you).Buckwheat, in all of its gluten-free glory, is actually closely related to rhubarb. In addition, it is an excellent source of fiber and nutrients. In particular, buckwheat groats (the small, triangular seeds), when cooked, offer 17 grams of dietary fiber or 68% of the daily requirement for a 2,000 calorie per day diet, as well as 22 grams of protein.

2698,More of an emergency preparedness question: What would be the shelf life?,"T. Hanson, according to my research on-line, it depends on how and where you store the dried fruit.  In pantry, cellar, etc. should last 6-12 months; refrigerator should last 1 to 2 years; freezer - indefinite. When I get these, I put 1 to 2 cups in my Food Saver machine (vacuum sealer) and seal them up, keeping them flat, then I stack them in a paper lunch bag - lying down on the counter - then, I stand the bags in my freezer.  When I want them, I take out one ""sealed"" bag and let it come to room temperature, open it up and enjoy the best dried cherries and blueberries I have ever had.  I have had some in the freezer for over a year now and used them during the holidays.  You would have thought I had just received them.  Traverse Bay is an exceptional product!!  I hope this helps - if you have a more specific question, please post it!

2703,How many T or tsps. are used for an 8 oz. serving?,I use 1-2 TB per 8 ounces depending on how strong you want it.  Sometimes I like to add a little milk for richness then I might use a little extra mix so it is nice a dark.  I like my cocoa strong flavored

You can tell if the inside of the can is orangey, no lining. If the inside is white, then there's still a BPA lining.  My cans are orangey inside :-). Great tomatoes, btw."

I have long since given up on this stuff- the only thing I've ever heard someone use it in and find it tolerable was in a chocolate protein smoothie (they wanted a hint of pb flavor) and even with all that flavor/sugar covering it up/helping it the person still could barely stand it. I threw mine out, it just wasn't worth trying to save for me. =p maybe slathering Nutella or something over it would help? (But uh...that sorta cancels out the whole point of this zero-calorie spread, doesn't it? Lol)"
2730,"It looks strange to have a ""Shipping Weight"" of 2.9 lbs. for ""3 lbs."" of nuts?",I have not noticed the weight difference.  I will say that the Kirkland Signature nuts are delicious.  Most are whole halves and some broken pieces.  Maybe the weight difference is in the package?.  The price is reasonable and product you cannot beat.  Just be sure the walnuts you order say Kirkland !

The dates are artificial, made up by various government rules that have nothing to do with the actual shelf life of a product (even fresh dairy dating varies by state in both length and requirement). There is a date stamped on the box. However, coconut is highly self stable, not prone to going stale or rancid as some other oils are. It is sealed in a plastic pouch which keeps out oxygen, too. This is a product that I would not worry about. Even when I have kept the contents in a jar in the cupboard for a long period after opening the package, I have never had it turn bad.

I don't think the bottle is even BPA free so there are a lot of plastic toxins. Safer to go with a glass bottle. I went back to buying it in a glass bottle at Sprouts (Super Target even carries it!)."
2735,How much liquid will one container of Thick-it 36 Oz thicken?,"It depends on your desired consistency. If you want to turn 4 oz of liquid (not counting pureed foods) into nectar consistency, use 1-2 Tablespoons of Thick-It. For honey consistency, use 2-3 T of Thick-It. And for Pudding consistency, use 3-4 T of Thick-It. I have a 30 oz container of Thick-It. A serving size is 2 T, with 106 servings per container. Hope that helps you with your calculations."

2751,What is the shelf life?,"Miso has an indefinite shelf life and will never spoil.  I've kept mine in the refrigerator for almost a year and it's still good.  This packaging is nice with the inner pouch plus the outer zip lock bag. The active nutrients in Miso will dissipate with heat, so always add miso paste after cooking or heating is finished and never reheat miso.  The enzymes in miso aid in digestion.  Ancient shogun warriors were fed hacho miso for strength and endurance, and the Emperor of Japan is said to enjoy hacho miso every day.  Enjoy!"

I was doing a very low carb. diet at the time, which caused some health issues even while I lost weight. I'm doing something different now that has helped me a lot so far. It may be that not dissolving the gelatin might have contributed to my developing allergy symptoms to gelatin. Mostly I believe it was the low carb. diet that was responsible.

2760,Does this come with a scooper?,"Hello Cara, This product does not include a scoop however the serving size on the label is three tablespoons."
2761,I just received my cashews and they are not the same as pictured. They smell like fish/shrimp. Is this normal? I've never had cashews smell like this.,why would you throw them out rather than return them???...amazon guarantees you get what you pay for..and fishy cachews are not acceptable.  I bought the cashew pieces to eat raw and they are very good..in smell and taste.
2762,made this in my bread machine. It ended up filling only half the pan. could this be because we had to sub the eggs for flax eggs?,"Mine is not big either. It's a little more than half the pan. And it's not a ""fluffy"" kind of bread, that's why I use it for toasts. It's small but tasty ;)They make a note about the ratio of water depending the altitude where you live, but I don't know if that would make a difference on the size of the loaf."
2763,how fresh are these? is there a expiration date?,"There is an expiration date, but it depends on the product. Newer batches expire later than older ones (naturally), but typically they last quite a while when wrapped and stored in a cool, dry place. Mine lasted a whole year before looking like they were getting old, but by then I was on the last orange, and it didn't last for much longer after. ;)"
2764,What are all of the vegetables in the juice?,"They used to have the picture of the ingredient label, but the full ingredients are as follows: ""Juice and Puree from Whole Organic Vegetables(Organic Tomatoes; Organic Carrots; Organic Celery; Organic Broccoli; Organic Kale; Organic Collard Greens; Organic Beets; Organic Parsley; Organic Lettuce; Organic Spinach; Organic Watercress); Organic Lemon Juice; Organic Jalapeno; Organic Garlic; Organic Cayenne Pepper; Pure Salt (No Additives)."""
2765,"My question is similar to the question above.  By 4 Packs, you mean 4 Boxes of 19?","Yes, there are 4 boxes of 19."
2766,This might be a silly question but is this an All-Purpose flour?,Yes.  I use it for making gluten free bread ... there is a recipe on the sack that is quite good.
2767,Is there any testing for radiation levels?,"The link provided by kit2 below is no longer functioning.  I did find their updated statement on their website if you copy the link I've put on here and google it, the company has a FAQ statement that will enable you to get the full testing process question answered satisfactorily.  ""Our president and founder Bill Carvalho has written an informative document regarding radiation in Wild Planet products.""

2773,Where is the country of origin?,I just checked this. It says china. I can't believe I didn't research it because I endeavor to never buy anything sourced in china. I guess this one slipped through. I do like the ginger it's a good price but I won't buy it again if its always been sourced in china. Here's a link for all country of origin frontier spices. https://crc.frontiercoop.com/brochures/high/FB_Catalog_Bulk_Products_Origins_Final.pdf

2777,what is the carb count?,"The box says 8% of Daily intake ... 24 g total, 1 g fiber & 18 g sugar .. not sure how that adds up to 24g.  But these are just as good as the ""non-gluten free"" versions.  We LOVE them as our alternative.  If you can handle that amount of carbs, these are a definite great buy!"
2778,is it non GMO?,"I'm nearly sure citric acid is not GMO:it's made by http://www.livestrong.com/article/477815-how-is-citric-acid-made-where-does-it-come-from/converting sugar with using a species of fungus;and since your cheapest sugar is gm corn,citric without a non-gmo label is likely a gm product ."
2779,Does the papain powder have a bad smell to it?,no
2780,This is going to be a Christmas gift for my clients. Does it comes in a wooden box? What are the dimensions of this item?,"It does come in a wooden box with seperaters, & I still use mine for fruit and nuts after the treats were eaten:) it's about  9"" x 11"""
2781,"If you use this in some pasta dough for instance and hand mix it, will it dye your skin on your hands?  What do you use to remove the squid ink if so?","Only time (multiple days to a week or so) and abrasion will remove the ink, so please, please, please use rubber gloves."
2782,Is this toasted?,I highly doubt it's toasted or cold pressed because it says nothing on the label stating either.
2783,Is this the same quanity (8 envelopes) that I buy for $2.29 at the grocery store?,"it is, only one box was sent when I ordered it. I was so disappointed.  Not sure how they are getting away with selling it for $8 dollars."

2786,About how much caffeine per scoop does this have?,The label reads 65 MG Caffeine per 8 fl. oz.
2787,Does this popcorn have a lot of hulls when popped?John,Paragon has very few hulls.  This is the best popcorn I've found.
2788,can this Almond Flour appropriate for Macaron?,Yes. I've been using it for my macarons and it works beautifully. The finest I've found so far.
2789,Has anyone used this on creeping ivy with any luck?,"had some creeping ivy, but it was too prolific and mixed in with grass that I did not want to kill so just had to use lawn chemical specific for creeping ivy and spot sprayed the patches and repeated and it did the job."
2790,is this product regular or bold?,It is regular and has very smooth flavor; not at all bitter.
2791,How sweet are these granola bars?  Do they taste like dessert?,Not super sweet - natural tasting
2792,what is the best if used by date.,I bought mine about 6 or 7 months ago and the use by date is 09/20/2016 which was 2 1/2 yers later. Still got 2 years to go.:)
2793,How many Tablespoons or Cups are in 16 oz (1 lb) of sprinkles?,"It's not an apples to apples comparison since one is a measure of weight/mass and the other is volume. However, I weighed a 1/3 cup of sprinkles and it was 2.5 ounces. Hope that helps."
2794,"Is this ""60"" pacs total? Am I reading it wrong?",Yes....6 boxes of 10 packs per box
2795,What does it taste like?,"I enjoy it but the taste for this type of product is a very personal experience.  I have read other reviews of people who might not like it but I am someone who enjoys natural tasting things.  I don't like something having a very sweet tasting chocolate and this does not.  You might want to go to a local Whole Food Store or some type of health food store as they usually sell one serving packets.  This way you can taste it before buying.  I did this when I bought another product I am now using and bought at Amazon called RAW meal replacement.  Much less expensive on Amazon and this is now my choice of for shakes.  Hope this helps.

2796,Why aren't the cooking directions on either label?,my back label had no instructions...looked online and found 1 part mix to 4 parts liquid.
2797,Are these bags biodegradable?,"They are unbleached paper, no wax or chlorine.  I hope they are biodegradable, because I am putting used bags in my compost pine.  :)"
2798,How many sachets per box?,"hello... there are 15 sachets per box, just like the hot chocolate/cocoa; and entire sachet should be used in one mug of about 6 to 8 oz of water, depending on how 'strong' you like.  cheers..."

2800,"Some early 2014 reviewers said they received generic white pumps, not Torani gold pumps. What are you shipping now (Jan 2015)?","I ordered 4 of them, and all of them are the gold Torani pumps. The work perfectly in the Torani syrup bottles."
2801,Hi I'm getting married August of 2015 however I wanted to know about how long is each stem?,I used these in Centerpieces - but doing. Wedding and bouquet for friend in December
2802,I bought stevia and it has a horrible aftertaste.  I want to try Truvia but I'm skeptical...looking for a healthy Splenda replacement.  Anyone?,"Truvia tastes OK to me, but the reason it has less of an aftertaste is because they mix it with alcohol sugars. Right now I use one packet of Stevia In The Raw. For what I use it for, it tastes fine, and it doesn't have the alcohol sugars added. If you research alcohol sugars, they don't digest. It's excreted in urine, so it can make you go to the bathroom more. Don't just take my word for it, google it."
2803,What's the difference between Katjes and Katja brands?,"They're a bit saltier, but still really great! Just slightly different."
2804,"What is the expiration date on these? I realize it will vary, but is it typically a few weeks or months or a year out?",The 18 I just received have an April 2015 date
2805,Do these lollipops have soft centers?,"No, not these."
2806,"Is this truly the original?  The photo is misleading, so I'm not sure what I would be getting.","The box is not the same as the ones I got. The ones I did get were very good.

2807,can you list the ingredients? I have alot of food allergies.,"Salt, spices (incl. paprika), dehydrated onion, herbs, dehydrated garlic, spice extractives (incl. paprika & capsium).  Calcium Silicate to allow free flow.  Allergy information:  Manufactured in a facility that processes dehydrated milk, soy protein and wheat flour products."
2808,Does the maple flavoring contain caramel coloring?,"No caramel coloring.  Ingredients are water, alcohol and natural maple flavoring."
2809,What are the ingredients?,"Not sure about the relationship between ""natural yeast extract"" and MSG...

2810,what is the shelf life of this product and how much does each capsule make,"I found to be safe 22.45 gallons per capsule, anymore and your pushing it."
2811,"How many bars in each individual package, one, two or four?",One bar per individual package. Assorted flavors.
2812,Is it fried or roasted?,roasted and they are really good
2813,what are the dimension of these item at full groth,This is a cactus and I believe it can grow to 15 feet ours is about 6 feet high and 2 to 3 feet wide
2814,wHat are the ingredients?,"Sweetleaf Stevia was the first stevia product to come on the market and is pure plant and plant fiber.  I think asking the ingredients is a good idea because not all stevia products are pure plant.  I actually use it daily for my coffee and other times I use it for my oatmeal, sweetening up tart berries, and anything that just needs a little bit of sweet.  There are no calories, and unlike the old saccharin products and even some modern day sugar substitutes, Sweetleaf Stevia is not a synthetic product.  And, it tastes good!"
2815,What is the expiration date?,Sep-14
2816,How long can they be stored for before going rancid/stale/nutritionally inferior?,around 7 - 9 months in fridge - around a year in freezer...   always smell them before you use them - they are oily so can go rancid
2817,how far in advance of event date should I order these?,"I guess it took at least a week for them to arrive. But I ordered them awhile ago so I don't remember exactly. But I mean, its honey so if you order it in advance it isn't going to go bad or anything. Better to order early and have them, than order a week before the event and then have them not show up on time."
2818,"These almonds appear to be shelled.  Please let me know if they are.  Many thanks, in advance, for your time and consideration.","Yes they are. also not toasted, roasted or salted. They are a bit cheaper at Costco but not worth the trip if that is all you need.I eat them for a quick snack."
2819,Could you please tell me the current expiration date?,The box that I received about a week ago had an expiration date of April 2015.
2820,what is the sodium count?,"Their regular brand has 940 mg. per tablespoon. The reduced sodium brand has 700 mg. per tablespoon. I doubt I use a whole tablespoon in an entire stir-fry dish (skillet full), plus, I go heavy on the pepper instead of the salt; and the results taste yummy. Try adding 1/2 tablespoon AFTER your stir-fry is completely done--NOT while cooking. That seems to make the Tamari stand out AND cause less stickiness in the pan. :)"
2821,is it hard or soft? .. when you squeeze it?,They hold together. Not hard nor soft. Just about right. In such a large can there are just a few which are breaking apart. These have a great flavor and texture.
2822,What are the ingredients?,"Organic Raw Cane Sugar,    Organic Fat-Reduced Cocoa Powder,    Organic Dark Chocolate Powder (which includes:    Organic Chocolate Liquor,    Organic Raw Cane Sugar,    Organic Cocoa Butter,    Soy Lecithin,    Organic Vanilla Extract)"
2823,are these cans bpa free?,I don't know. There is nothing on the label that is wrapped around the can to indicate one way or the other. I checked their website and could not find any information concerning the bpa issue. You could always give them a call and ask. I hope this helps.
2824,Can these be frozen if you only need 1/2 of the for a party?,"Absolutely.  I buy several packages and keep them in the freezer for impromptu times.   Makes great garlic bread, cheese bread, etc."
2825,I want to make a mix of garlic & peppercorns to put through a grinder for table use. Would this product be firm enough to grate with the peppercorns?,"I think so yes, as it is freeze-dried.  Actually, that's a good idea and I think I will try it.   We live in Reno where it is SUPER dry...so moisture in the air is not a problem here."
2826,what is the expiration date of the items if i order today?,"The box of bags I received last week (week of Feb 8, 2015) says: Guaranteed Fresh Until 14 AUG 15.But as it's a sealed bag and there's really nothing to spoil, I would pay absolutely no attention to it and it does not say anything about spoiling, only freshness."
2827,Does this work to ward off Vampires or do I need to use fresh garlic ?,This will actually work but you'll need to rehydrate the garlic in holy water prior to use .
2828,"How can you ask questions about this item? There is a significant lack of information on the item, and I don't see how to ask questions about it. Is it whole grain? white? Bleached? Stone ground??",I went directly to this company's website and emailed them.  They responded to me that way.  It is whole grain spelt flour.
2829,"Are these cherries dead as well as being dried, or are they zombie cherries?  It's important to be specific about this sort of thing.","I can swear to you that I have never seen these cherries rouse themselves and move around in shuffling mobs, unless I have been drinking heavily."
2830,What are the ingredients? Does it contain any type of sugar?,"Absolutely no sweetener of any kind. Made of water, alcohol, propylene glycol, & artificial flavors. Not the real thing but tastes good in our smoothies or cheesecake."
2831,"how many calories per cup (or serving, whatever that might be)?","serving size is one cup, it contains 60 calories"
2832,"Is there real actual fruit on the bottom, or are they only fruit flavored?","No real fruit on the bottom, only the fruit flavored. My baby loves all three."
2833,"Just want to be sure they haven't changed the ingredients, can you post the list of ingredients?","Long list: sugar, gum base, glucose syrup, modified food starch, artificial and natural flavoring, aspartame, candelilla wax, yellow 5, blue 1, partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, water.  Nothing healthy...but I do not swallow!"
2834,How come this oil doesn't smell like coconut oil? :(,It has been deodorized. It is guaranteed 100% natural.
2835,Is this product made from roasted seeds?  Also is it whole-seed or hulled?,It appears to be made from roasted seeds. I'm not sure about whether it is whole seed or hulled.
2836,Is the product Certified organic ?,"I did not see the stamp. It was in a plain clear plastic bag, inside a plain brown box."
2837,Does this tagliatelle pasta contain EGGS? I am vegan and this is very important to me. Thank you!,No eggs!!!  Just organic durum wheat semolina and pure mountain spring water.
2838,"how many grams the one cup stick , as 1 cup in the UK = 240 grams ,in the US = 120 grams , i need to know exactly how many grams in one stick.thanks.",240 grams
2839,Raising the price by almost 2.00 is not a good Idea. Won't be buying regularly now.Your thoughts?,Based on a the fact that when this product was sold at retail outlets here in the US the average price was 2.75 a can I can live with the 2.00 price increase.  Just make the product readily available without all the delays.  Maybe offer a discount for those that buy in bulk?
2840,Are these nuts roasted?,Yes-- and so tasty :-)
2841,What is manuka stands?,"It's honey from New Zealand, and it's supposed to have special healing properties."
2842,does this product have a pop up pourer spout when you open the cap?,Yes it does!..have not tried it yet..
2843,Has anyone tried tried this for making yogurt?,"Fiori is right yogurt is made with bacterial cultures, but some commercial yogurts have pectin in them as a thickener because the yogurt isn't given enough time to thicken naturally."
2844,"I'd like to order a box of the smoked chubs, but would like to know approx. how large the fish are.  I prefer the small size of about 8-10 inches.",When you order from here they are about 12 inch pieces of fish that you can section.
2845,Is this pod compatible with the nespresso U machine?,"Although I have not tried, I would say no because they are a slightly different size and shape."
2846,Is it ok to mix half a cup of this uncooked into yogurt?,sure - I eat it uncooked all the time
2847,Is there an expiration date? I don't know how long it would take to eat 8 lbs.,On mine there's sell by date 6/15/2015
2848,Does this have yellow food dye in it?,"According to the packaging from my order, no yellow food dye.  It does contain blue 1 and red 40."
2849,"How long can you keep it in your cupboard, what kind of  expiration date is on this ?","I think it would vary. Mine has a date of 2016 but it goes fast. It makes great chicken salad,my son takes it in his lunch just as it comes from the canand even my little chiuhauha eats it if I run out of other food she likes. It comes to $3.25 a can but 12 oz can with some water maybe 10 oz drained. With tuna getting so pricy and less and less in the can this chicken is a decent buy. I hope you like it. If you belong to Cosco it is their brand."
2850,"Aproximately, how many sheets you could print with this set? 8 X 11""",The ink is pretty much terrible you're probably going to get about maybe 10 to 15 good sheets the ink isn't the same quality like it used to be I would look somewhere else
2851,Does anyone know the country of origin for this product?,"I too was very concerned about country of origin AS THE PRODUCT IS NOT so labeled.I contacted the seller and after two emails back and forth was told:  China.  I asked if Pumpkin seeds were available from US and was told that this product is not available other than from China.   I wish I knew if that was true.  I am not happy buying food from China where I know that many ecological conditions are very bad.   Oh well, I will use up the big package and in several months try hard again to find this product from U.S. source."
2852,Do you recommend disinfecting these seeds?,"Hi Kathryn:I just rinse the seeds off before the initial soaking.  I believe they are organic, so they should be fine.But contact The Sprout House if you are worried.Best,Sarah"
2853,Are these sulphured?,I am pretty sure there is no sulphur
2854,what is the difference between the :One 1 Pound LB Madagascar Bourbon Planifolia Extract Grade B and 1 lb Madagascar bourbon a/b splits,Madagascar is just where they're grown. They splits are usually more flavorful and better for making vanilla extract.
2855,Is this oil good for high heat cooking? What is the smoke point?,I have tried it for high temp pan searing and I was pleasantly surprised that it did not smoke. Avocado oil has a stated smoke point of 500 degrees F and seems to warrant that rating. The taste is also quite good. I will order again when needed.
2856,do these have 3rd party organic certification?,I was going to order these until I saw that the seeds are from China.  Thanks for the info!
2857,maltitol? Xylitol? Sorbitol? Sugar Alcohols?,Sucralose (Splenda)
2858,"My vanilla beans arrived, but are frozen solid because of the sub-zero temperatures. Are they still usable to make vanilla, or are they ruined?","I realize it's a bit late to help you, but for anyone reading this later:Frozen vanilla beans should still be usable for extract, but I would suggest using them right away. Freezing or refrigerating can promote certain types of mold in vanilla beans, but it shouldn't affect the flavor compounds in the beans."
2859,where was manufactured the cans you have? mexico or liverpool? i just want you to know to order,"You need to ask the seller directly this question, as it may depend per seller.  To ask the seller, you click on the sellers name where it says ""Sold by"".  And on the right column towards the bottom it says: ""Further information"" and click on ""contact the seller"".   Yeah it's not easy to find, but that is where you can ask a seller specific questions of their lot.   This is for general questions regarding the formula in general.  Such as:  ""Does it work?"" and the answer to that is yes."
2860,can this be put in a squieeze bottle [ketchup] etc and used ?,"It's a little thicker than ketchup so I would use a bottle that has a wider opening, but otherwise it should work fine."
2861,Is it one package divided up for a total of 11 oz. or two 11 oz packages? Can anyone clarify please?,Each bag is 11 oz.  There are two bags.
2862,I would like to use it for making a nut brittle.  Could I substitute it for both the brown and white sugars called for in the recipe?,"Hi, this sugar is very much like brown sugar.  I use it for everything right now except for tea as it does taste different there.  I use this coconut sugar for all my baking and sometimes do mix it with white sugar and sometimes not.  I have never made brittle with it but I'm guessing you would be OK to use this exclusively and cut out the white.  Good Luck!"
2863,Is this the wrong picture. I thought it was purple not green. I want to buy but the picture of the box should be a purple Pilao .... is this correct..,"Pilao Intenso comes in a purple bag, regular Pilao comes in a red bag. This is the wrong picture, this is Melitta (different brand) Extra Forte."
2864,"What is ""frustration Free"" packaging? I've ordered the 2lb mixed bag before. Thanks! LOVE these!",It was just a simple plastic bag.
2865,Have the EZ k-cup and filter.  Why am I getting such weak coffee? Keep trying but to me it is worthless. Am ready to try something new,I put two scoops of coffee in the filter for each cup of coffee. It pretty much fills the whole filter inside the pod. Once I put the cap on I give the bottom where the spring is a little push to compact the coffee then brew at the larger cup setting. Makes a great cup every time! Maybe it's the type of coffee or the amount you're using?
2866,How do you prepare this chocolate? do you need a special machine?,"Yes, these are for Keurig machines. Delicious!"
2867,can you bake with it?,My son hated the chocolate cake I made with hemp oil. My husband loved it.  It does have a distinct taste.  So really depends how much you like the flavor.
2868,is this made with real sugar and not any artifical sweenters such as sucralose or aspartme?,Ya they have real sugar there are no artificial sugars.
2869,Are all 6 boxes of Cran-Grape?,Yes.
2870,Can they be frozen?,"My experience is that they can be, but they keep for quite a while so it may not be needed. If they get hard, just put them on a plate in the microwave for  10-15 seconds and they will be soft, chewy and delicious!"
2871,Does anyone know if these contain lead? The ones from Hong Kong and Taiwan were banned due to overexposure of lead...does anyone know?,"While I'm not 100% sure I don't believe that they do, they would have been removed from Amazon if they did"
2872,"Where is it manufactured, from where do the ingredients come?  Made in USA is big positive for many","All the ingredients are organic. There is no coffee in the mix. The mix has roasted barley, roasted rye, roasted chicory, ashwagandha, shatavari, brahmi, and French vanilla flavor. It is distributed from Fairfield, IA. Their website is: www.ayurvedicroast.com.It says it is made in the USA."
2873,"it says 5 flavors, but how many packets of each flavor?","There are three packets of each flavor, for a total of 15 individual cups of miso soup."
2874,Can you eat a tablespoon of coconut oil by itself? Or do you mix it with something? Thanks,"Hi Monica,  If you can stand it that way, I do not see why not.  I put it in my mom's oatmeal.  Some people put it on their toast instead of butter.  I read where one man put it in his hot tea, this gave my mom a upset stomach so we quit that.  You can bake it in muffins too.  Hope this helps your question. :)"
2875,Can I use this product for windows in gingerbread houses?,"it is fragile and cracks easily, but would be look great.  Water shrivels the product, so cut with great care.  Good luck!"
2876,Are the nuts salted or unsalted?,I just read the product description and it says the Cashews are salted. Not sure about the Almonds.
2877,Can I use this coffee safely for super automatic machine ( Delonghi 23.450s ) ?,It worked great in my perk and in my fully automatic grind and brew machine!
2878,Is this 6 boxes?,"YES, there are 6 boxes (with 5 in each box); 30 bars total. AND they are delicious, in my opinion. I'm hooked on them and they are also very healthy!!! Hope this helped. :-)"
2879,I have put in an order but saw no where to choose the flavors that I wanted,"You can send them to contact seller.  You order is in pending, when it comes out of pending I can send you a email and you can respond to that."
2880,Is the package 5 of each mix?,No it is actually one of each box.
2881,They don't list the ingredients.  Is it vegan?,"The jar lists these: sugar, non-hydrogenated palm and or canola oil almonds, low fat cocoa powder, skim milk powder,whey, soy flour, soy lecithin.  Hope this helps."
2882,Ingredients?,"Sugar, butter, water, fruit pectin, citric acid, lemon oil, concentrated lemon juice and whole pasteurized egg."
2883,What do these taste like? Please be descriptive!,"The taste of this cherry covered chocolate is sweet and bitter and has a hint of the taste of alcohol, which is perfectly balanced, I think.I don't like chocolate that is too sweet and don't like cherry that is taste like a plastic cherry. I like this chocolate since over 30 years ago and I couldn't find this for long time. Last time when I got this chocolate, the taste was just like I dreamed of, and it didn't disappoint me at all!"
2884,Are they free of leaven?,Leavened matzo is an oxymoron.  No matzo is leavened.  The whole point is to celebrate the Israelites escaping from Egypt and not having the time to allow the bread to rise while on the run.
2885,"Camel Milk Powder - Made from 100% Pure Camel Milk , what is the weight?",1.2 pounds
2886,Do these dates have pits?,Yes they did have pits. I din't realize it until I received them
2887,"After I break the seal, do I have to refrigerate the olives (takes up a lot of fridge space)?",Yes they last longer
2888,Is this for toddlers only?  Do you have a formula suitable for a 10 month old baby?,"I am kind of angry at Nature's One cause I don't feel they are really transparent. It's really hard to find the information about why Baby's Only make babies so constipated: the truth is, this formula is EXTREMELY casein-dominant, much more than any casein-dominant infant formula. This is the reason why they market it as toddler formula, and not just because the company wants to promote infant breastfeading like their consumer service told me when I asked them about infant suitability. Unlike whey, casein is really hard to digest and makes babies constipated. The proteins in Baby's Only are 18% whey and 82% casein, exactly like cow milk, therefore it is NOT suitable for infants (for the record, proteins in breast milk are 90% whey/10% casein in early lactation, 60/40 in mature milk and 50/50 in late lactation). I don't think it's fair that we have to do so much research to find out about it. I feel cheated.

2889,Is this popcorn organically raised?,"Hi all. Just found this comment string and we are the grower/producer of the product. Tons of places on Amazon where reviews, comments, questions are posted and we're just a small company with less than 4 employees -- took awhile to realize where these questions were posted.Our popcorn is not USDA certified organic.  We use a special organic fertilizer that includes trace minerals -- we developed the fertilizer specifically for our heirloom variety which is completely different (and grows differently) than all other varieties of corn being grown today.  We do not use any pesticides at all.  The one aspect that currently prevents organic certification is the use of non-residual herbicide during the first 20% of the growing season.  Our popcorn grows very very slowly and the weeds/grasses are a huge hurdle for us.  The herbicide never enters the plant (not residual) and only targets the other grasses/weeds on contact.  Nothing enters our popcorn plant and to be even more sure, it's only applied months before any ears (and kernels) think about developing.Some people tell us to ""just do it organically"" -- but unfortunately the yield of this popcorn (less than 2,000 lbs per acre) makes it impossible and unaffordable to do so.  It would probably yield less than 1,000 lbs per acre if we didn't fight the weeds/grasses with herbicide.  In comparison, most of the conventional popcorn varieties are growing between 5,000 and up to 10,000 lbs per acre.  We're already on the edge of being able to produce the product remotely affordably.  Our first goal is to preserve and expand this heirloom variety and down the road we will see if expanding into organic is possible.Hope you enjoy!!

2890,Hard for me to visualize eight pounds....can someone advise about how many tortillas we are talking here?  Thanks!,"Sure!  They come in 8, 1 pound packages.  Approx. 20 tortillas to a package.  I purchased them not to long ago and they were delicious.  You can freeze them also.  That's what I was concerned about.  I knew we wouldn't eat 8 packages of tortillas before they would go bad, so I just froze 7 packages & just kept 1 package in the fridge!  Worked perfectly.  When I was ready for more, I just pulled a package out of the freezer, let them thaw & we ate them!"
2891,are thet out of the shell?,"No, they have not been shelled."
2892,Is this creamy or chunky?  Thank You,This was creamy:-)
2893,Can these capsules be used with the Varismo Kafee machine to make lattes?,"w never tried so we can suggest doing so , but if teh capsules are the same exact shape you may be willing to try"
2894,what are the ingredients?  what type of protein is it,Don't know the exact ingredients. Should be printed on the side on the label. It IS a diary product but Core Power seems to have refined it to the point of eliminating the more harmful dairy ingredients - and given the extract a great taste (no 'chalkiness' typically associated with protein drinks.)
2895,Were these packed individually?  Was wanting some for a pinata but don't want the candy to hit the ground if it isn't packaged.,No - they are in a larger plastic bag.  There are versions that are packed individually in plastic.
2896,"How many cubes in a box, approximately?","Mayby 200, gives the coffee a great flavor."
2897,How many calories?,130 calories
2898,can I get mostly pink flowers,"If you include a note at checkout or message the seller immediately after, they're able to accommodate color requests very easily!"

2900,Has anyone else noticed a 30% price increase on this product in the last month or are there other ways around this?,"Good Morning,My name is Mayra Flores, an employee at Rogers Family Coffee Company, the manufacturer for these San Francisco Bay products. In response to your inquiry, the current issue is caused because this product that is sold by and shipped by Amazon is out of stock.

2901,Are KIND bars non-GMO certified?,Some but not all of their products.go to website nongmoproject.org for the listing. Hope that helps
2902,What is this sweetened with?,"Sugar.(Ingredients: sugar, citric acid, blend of instant black teas, natural flavors, lemon juice solids -- in that order) It's delicious!"

2904,"What is the difference between the ""blue box"" and the ""white box""? is there a difference in the blend or is it strictly a change in packaging?","Per PG Tips website, the white and lite blue box are the same tea, just different amounts of bags or volume of loose tea. Other strengths or flavors of tea have different colored boxes; PG Gold is a black box; PG Strong is a deep red box, etc."
2905,Is the mouth of the carafe large enough to get my hand in for cleaning?  And is there a lid for the carafe?,"The mouth is about 4 inches wide.  A well-designed lid screws onto the top of the carafe; the lid has a push button mechanism that opens the carafe for pouring.  The coffee stays hot because until you push the button, the pot is completely sealed.  I've timed the whole procedure from measuring eight cups of water into the tea kettle, boiling and pouring the water through the drip mechanism, screwing on the top: 15 minutes.  The taste of the coffee makes it worth the time it takes."
2906,Is this organic,yes
2907,How long will it take to recieve my package?,3-5 business days
2908,Does it have preservatives?,Ingredients are pitted apricots and sulfur dioxide.
2909,For those with live terrariums how well has this moss held up? Is it still alive?,"I buy moss from this supplier regularly.  I've never had any problem with any of the species, including the two I've been shipped under the name ""sheet-moss.""  I terrariums for sale, but the few I've kept or given to friends as gifts are all still going strong & many are well over 24 months old at this point."
2910,"Is there any nutritional info on this?  I.E. fat & sodium content, etc.","OK Here goes:Serving size 15g, Cal 70, Cal Fat 37g, Fat 4g (6%), Cholest 8.7g (3%), total carb 6.2g (2%), Fiber .44g (2%), Protein 2.4g (5%).Sodium is somewhat high (I'm on a restricted diet); however, I don't eat this as a bowl of soup.  I just put a few tablespoons of cheese sauce (see my recipe) over my veggies.  Good stuff!"
2911,What are the ingredients of this root beer extract?,"Water, Caramel Color, Alcohol, Natural and Artificial Flavor, Sulfiting Agents, and FD&C; red#40 lake.   (That all it says on the bottle.  I like it a lot.  Shake well because the cinnamon and other spices settle out at the bottom.)"
2912,"What is the ""shelf life"" of the vitamin bursts before using?",The riper the berry the sweeter the juice!
2913,What is the sodium content per 1 oz bag?,For a 6 oz bag the sodium per serving is 190 mg.  Serving size is 1oz and the servings per container are 6.
2914,How many pounds is this order?,about 1/2 pound from my recollection.  My PCA LOVED it!
2915,"How many sticks per pack, 5 or 9? Thanks",9 Sticks per pack.
2916,is there any percentages of alcohol or bacon fat on it ??,No
2917,what is the best buy date and packed on date?,I repackaged it into a zip lock shortly after purchase and do not recall. I apologize that I cannot be of assistance.

2919,How many candies in the 36ozContainer?,Saunders website states it is 48 pieces
2920,how many package in a case?,"You can get single packets of the soup at Walmart for less than $3.00. I don't know how many packs in a case but at this price for a single packet, I would look elsewhere."
2921,Are there any research studies that show the difference in the grades of matcha green tea as far as the health benefits go?,"I am not so sure about the difference in grades, but I can tell you to be careful to buy 100% matcha. Several brands of matcha actually have brown rice fillers. This brand (Ryu Mei) is one of my favorites but a tad expensive (I drink matcha every day). Mighty Leaf Tea makes a more reasonable priced matcha."
2922,"Hello, How sturdily is this made?  Does the material seem of good quality, and not brittle or too lightweight?  Thanks for your input!",I own the microwave noodle bowl and also the 20 oz mug. Both are very sturdy. You could throw them in a lunchbox or backpack without worries. I have been impressed with Sistema products and am acquiring quite a collection.
2923,Are these chia seeds by CHOSEN FOODS 100% ORGANIC? I can't tell from the pictures...,"I called the company after I received the box of seeds and they are the ones who supply to Bobs Red Mill. They come from Mexico, but the box also came with a certificate showing the lab analysis and the breakdown of the product contents. They state they have no pesticides,etc. and when I talked with the company the gentleman stated they were indeed organic. I've been using this box for quite some time and all is well. But price for price it's about the same as you would pay from Wegman's whole foods section. The best part is the grocery store doesn't provide a lab analysis, but the Chosen Foods company does. They are wholesalers and supply to many companies. Hope this helps with info you need to make a realistic decision.

   I called the company after I received the box of seeds and they are the ones who supply to Bobs Red Mill. They come from Mexico, but the box also came with a certificate showing the lab analysis and the breakdown of the product contents. They state they have no pesticides,etc. and when I talked with the company the gentleman stated they were indeed organic. I've been using this box for quite some time and all is well. But price for price it's about the same as you would pay from Wegman's whole foods section. The best part is the grocery store doesn't provide a lab analysis, but the Chosen Foods company does. They are wholesalers and supply to many companies. Hope this helps with info you need to make a realistic decision.

While we have chosen not to pay the thousands of dollars for a government ""certification"" as Organic, we are as close as it gets. We bottle only our own honey, from our own hives. We do NOT blend, mix, micro-filter, or heat pasteurize our honey.

2956,Has anyone compared this to KAL stevia (which in my opinion was the best tasting before they added filler)?,"Yes I did compare Stevia Select and KAL Stevia.  However, please understand each of us will have a slightly different opinion of this product based on our taste buds due to our bodies and life habits such as; non smoker vs smoker, dental work, etc.Having lived on KAL Stevia for years, it was a shock to find out that they had added fillers to their products along with increasing prices.  It should not have been a surprise however as I found it took more product to give me the  taste I was used to in my food and drink.  Needless to say, as a consumer I felt betrayed.  There was no red label saying new and improved with fillers!  No, it seemed to have been done quietly.In my weeks and months of reading and searching I found, Stevia Select.  It is not a perfect match to the old KAL Stevia, but it is, as close as I have been able to come. Example: With the Old KAL Stevia, you could put it in any iced drink (after you had poured it) and it seemed to immediately dissolve evenly with only gentle stirring.  With Stevia Select, you put your Stevia in ""FIRST"", then add your liquid, cereal or whatever and stir gently.  The Stevia seems to quickly dissolve and distributes nicely, rarely do I need extra stirring for better distribution of the Stevia.As with KAL Stevia, if you put too much in at one time you will get a slightly bitter taste.  Using the small measuring spoon, provided in Stevia Select, place one level spoonful of Stevia Select into a cup or glass, now pour in your beverage. Do a taste test.  Do this until you reach a sweet taste that is perfect for you, but not so much that you get a bitter after taste.  Summary:  KAL Stevia Vs Stevia SelectBitter TasteKal Stevia:  Too much Stevia gives a bitter after taste that can overpower what you are eating or drinking.Stevia Select:  The same is true for Stevia Select, don't use as much product.Dissolves & Distribution of SweetnerKal Stevia: Dissolves on top of drinks and distributes well, gentle stirring required.Stevia Select: Dissolves best with drinks poured on top of the Stevia, gentle stirring required.Amount of ProductKal Stevia:  Less Stevia and more fillers now require more product to reach the familiar sweet taste.Stevia Select:  No fillers.  Less Stevia is needed to reach the familiar sweet taste.CostKal Stevia: The product has been altered, it now has fillers mixed with the Steiva.  This means you are buying less Stevia Product.  To compensate, the containers (to me anyway) seemed to enlarge and a higher price tag installed.Stevia Extract: 100% pure and seems reasonable priced and affordable. And no, I am not affiliated with Stevia Select nor any other product.  I am simply a consumer.
