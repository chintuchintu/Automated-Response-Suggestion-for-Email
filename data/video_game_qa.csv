2,"The Saitek X52 is an awesome value with good performance.  There are some longivity issues but it's still a good setup that offers the most features for the money, great for a first timer.CH Products aren't as flashy and modern looking but tend to last a long time and have excellent sensitivity and accuracy.  The CH software is also very lightweight on resources and offers good programing and the ability to combine multiple devices into one virtual joystick for compatibility with more programs.  CH also has a helpful fan base and third party forums, search for CH Hangar in Google.","The Saitek X52 is an awesome value with good performance.

Also, I tend to get the most bites in the river on the farm, just below the chicken coop and nearby the bridge. This may not be true for everyone, it just seems to be the case when I play. Hope this helps!","Well, neither the guide nor the game developers really say what the best time is, but I've found that when I go fishing, there tend to be more bites on rainy days at any time, and on sunny days from about 7-9am and 6-10pm.

15,"I bought this keyboard even after reading some of the complaints.  It's great.  Some seldom used key combinations have issues.  The one problematic key combination is CTL+R+any key.  CTL+R does work fine though. Some use CTL to crouch in games (I use ALT) so you can see where CTL+R+W migt be an issue. http://prosperouspoverty.blogspot.com/2009/02/microsoft-sidewinder-x6-gaming-keyboard.html has a great write up on the board and addresses concerns for purchasers including the problematic key combinations.  The noise about the lack of height adjusters on the back IMO is over blown since the board slopes slightly upwards.  Additionally the non removable hand rest is higher than my Saitek Elcipse was so I haven't had a problem.  This was my one main concern and I thought worse case I would put something under to slant it but I haven't had to.

27,"Yes & No - Yes if you are playing it WITH the 1.7version patch you get from Bethesda's website. This is to make it compatible with 4 core an more CPU/processors (game was built when 2 core's were common) an other things. Now for modding which I have done, I have no issues with Windows 7 nor should you with Windows 8 (I am aware of it's problems, why I stayed at W7 Pro). because there are mods & fixes for everything at NexusMods. Please remember to install game in folder other than Program Files because Windows UAC feature causes problems. For example C:Games/Fallout3. Also note that Windows Live no longer exists so you can not validate it nor do you have to. You essentially are buying this so not to get malware or viruses from pirated copies or you just do not want to wait forever to download it off steam. Took me 5 days to get it running good with over 50GB worth of mods. Great learning experience, awesome game, 10000X better than when I first played it.

You DO do things like run aliens over, or jab a knife in their brainpan, but it is just comic violence. Like LEGO games; isn't it morbid to hit someone and have them explode into pieces? ;) Just saying, this game has violence but it is very mild. Many of the Halo games are not deserving of their Mature rating. Hope this helps you some!

782,"Yes but it will not play exactly like a GameCube Controller would. This adapter causes the Wii U to recognize the controller as a Classic Controller, and some liberties had to be taken in order to make this happen. For example, the shoulder buttons on the Cube Controller are pressure sensitive and the Classic Controller's are not, so this adapter will not read the degree of pressure you're putting on the shoulder buttons. You have to press the GameCube Controller's shoulder buttons all the way down in order for the console to recognize it as a button press. For a more faithful and high quality adapter, I recommend the official adapter (the one with four Controller ports that plugs into the Wii 's USBs). I own both and after using the official one, I'm never going back to using the Mayflash one.

1040,"It's actually quite fun regardless of age. I would even bet most of the players are older! I wouldn't judge it based in its wonky and cartoonish presentation. It's rather very competitive, deep, and balanced, and a lot of fun actually. I found me and my friends got hooked on it for months. IMO it's the best xbox one game to date. Looks great, plays great and it fun what more could you want It's has a third person view, also a zombie or plant master mode where you kind of micromanage as well. Has character cards to unlock abilities and customization for classes. A survival wave mode, team death match, and a domination style mode. All of them are very fun. Every class requires a certain strategy to succeed. I recommend the game to anyone honestly. It's out for Microsoft consoles but will be out on pc and ps3 and ps4 soon I believe

1083,"Stuck Knob Solution here!   Hello, I had the same problem and found the perfect solution online (for just $2.99):  In order to fix this problem you just need a larger knob which provides the extra leverage needed to (effortlessly) turn the knob.  The original knob should come off easily by wiggling and pulling at the same time.  The knob is attached to a 1/4'' shaft so any larger knob that fits a 1/4'' shaft will do fine.   I used one from radio shack (Model: 274-407), which was 1/4'' shaft and it also contained a micro screw that you can tighten to ensure a snug fit. This knob slightly covers the labels (ALT,VS IAS, etc) but because these values show up on the screen as you tune to them, it's no big deal for me.  Btw,  I attempted to contact Saitek for a solution and shocker! -No Response.

1086,"I'd say yes, especially if you are a fan of the series. It's pretty much on par with Gears 3 as far as graphics game play etc. I too only purchased it for the campaign mode. One thing judgement has is; you'll come to a variety of different types of side/bonus missions that are optional during the campaign. You'll know when you come to them, because there will be a red gears emblem on the wall, and they aren't hard to find. Walk up to it and you can either accept or deny if you want to play it. It's kinda like horde mode on online. You and the crew have to face usually two waves of various types of enemies. So it's kind of like a run and gun type of affair. You'll earn stars, badges, etc for completing/doing various things when playing them. So that adds to the campaign as well. I am very pleased with my purchase. I've only completed the first few chapters; because I bought 7 other games at the time. So I have a lot of love to spread around, lol. Another recommendation that I have for you is Tomb Raider if you haven't played it already. That's where most of my gaming time is spent. It's a very good game, and I highly recommend it. I'm playing it on the ps3 however. I would definitely recommend Gears judgment as well since you are a fan of the series. I noticed the other answers were short, so I tried to provide additional information to help you out with your decision. Hope this helps with determining whether you purchase it or not.
